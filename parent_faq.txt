Foreword by Janice D. Chaffin
P
ricing isn’t sexy.
I know my teenage daughters don’t think I’m on the leading edge of pop culture, 
but I’m confi dent I’m right about this. 
I bet you’ve never heard anyone say, “We just hired a Top 10 MBA grad from Stanford 
and we’re putting her in charge of pricing.”
There are no books about pricing on the best-seller list; they are never displayed beside 
Good to Great or The Fifth Discipline. While there’s a new book about how to sell effec-
tively every few weeks, there are hardly any books on the discipline of pricing effectively.
While pricing isn’t sexy, it is strategic. That’s why I’m hoping you’ll pick up and read 
this valuable book. 
Why is pricing strategic? I can think of three reasons.
Pricing moves customers (and market share). And despite what you may hear from 
salespeople as the end of a quarter approaches, lower prices do not necessarily mean more 
sales, or more profi t. 
Pricing moves markets. If you’ll permit me to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan, pricing 
is the message. In an age when “Free” is a viable business strategy, more than ever pric-
ing decisions communicate important things about your brand, your business model, and 
your product. 
Pricing moves stock prices. Witness the gyrations in Apple’s stock price when it an-
nounces whether or how much it’s cutting the price of the last generation of hardware. 
Even changing pricing on our Norton products can cause Wall Street analysts to make 
assumptions about our future business. 
That’s the power of pricing. But too many managers and executives think of pricing as 
just a fi nance issue. Increasingly I see business leaders who think pricing is entirely out of 
their hands; they perceive themselves as helpless in the face of market forces.
When I fi rst joined the Consumer Business Unit at Symantec, the organization didn’t 
fully realize the pricing power that we had—and how we could use pricing as a way of 
gaining strategic advantage in a very competitive market. Tim Smith helped us change the 
way pricing is perceived throughout the organization.
We engaged Tim as a consultant to help us take a fresh look at pricing and, critically, 
our pricing management practices. Given Symantec’s global presence and the multitude 
of channels we work through, pricing decisions involve local, regional and channel-
specifi c sales teams, as well as fi nance and often a retail partner. At the time, there was 
no central management of pricing. This led to confusion and sometimes ad-hoc deci-
sions but, worst of all, it meant decisions were often made without the necessary data 
and insight. 
Tim’s expertise helped us overhaul our pricing governance, set up a central pricing 
 management team, and create the appropriate organizational structure and focus to 
 advance our pricing practices and management capabilities. His suggestions have enabled 
our organization to benefi t from improved analytics and coordination across markets and 
channels.

Good pricing governance doesn’t mean taking the decisions out of the hands of the 
regional sales teams. No pricing strategy will work if the sales teams don’t understand 
and support it. However, Tim also helped educate our global sales force so that they 
understood the pricing strategy, how to make pricing decisions, and the impact of those 
decisions on our bottom line. 
The proof of the value of pricing management is visible right in our bottom line. The 
increased organizational focus we have placed on pricing management has delivered a 5% 
increase in profi tability. 
That’s why I can highly recommend Tim’s book. I’ve seen what treating pricing as a 
strategic issue can do. And although pricing may never make the cover of US Weekly, or 
even the business book best-seller list, I daresay that after reading this book you may start 
to think of pricing as sexy. (Probably not, but anything’s possible.)

Preface
P
ricing Strategy is a comprehensive text on pricing, examining pricing decisions with 
an aim to maximize a fi rm’s profi ts through creating and capturing customers. With 
each price decision opportunity, this book highlights the stakeholder’s importance 
of the decision, the key tradeoffs to consider in selecting between opposing outcomes, and 
the infl uences that should guide the decision. 
Pricing Strategy directly addresses the major pricing decisions confronting today’s execu-
tive, providing a comprehensive approach to managing the pressing price decisions. It goes 
more to the point than an economics text that focuses on industry-level dynamics, a market-
ing text that mentions price as just one of several levers under management, an accounting 
text that provides the mechanics of price-to-profi t relationships but lacks insight necessary for 
making price decisions, or a strategy text that deals with industry and competitive dynamics. 
Pricing Strategy has been written as a practical guide for making pricing decisions for the 
general MBA student or working professional. Students concentrating on marketing, eco-
nomics, fi nance, strategy, or operations will all fi nd the text approachable. It is designed for 
use within any competitive industry: business and consumer markets, durable and consum-
able markets, tangible and intangible markets. As such, working executives will also fi nd 
Pricing Strategy highly benefi cial in improving their decision making. Senior executives will 
value this text for its succinctly defi ned core concepts and techniques for managing prices. 
Similarly, specialized pricing practitioners who are primarily charged with managing prices 
will appreciate this text for its depth in defi ning models and enabling nuanced analysis. 
Readers who want to understand a specifi c quantitative technique in pricing can use this 
text as a foundation. To equip readers to potentially compete within the fi eld of pricing, spe-
cialized vocabulary is introduced throughout the text as necessary. Numerous case studies, 
examples, tables, and graphics further communicate the concepts contained within this text.
Pricing as a fi eld spans many disciplines. Pricing Strategy leverages the best thinking 
in marketing, economics, competitive strategy, consumer behavior, and fi nance to de-
liver a comprehensive text on pricing. It is written primarily to better communicate well- 
documented existing knowledge, along with new ideas developed from logical insights, 
executive discussions, and mathematical proofs. 
One of the larger challenges of communicating best practices in pricing is the issue 
of balancing quantitative skill sets with qualitative concepts. Students require familiarity 
with specifi c mathematical concepts and formulas to perform basic tasks in pricing. Yet 
pricing is not a purely quantitative fi eld. Much of pricing, and the infl uences to price posi-
tioning, price setting, and price management, are conceptual in nature. 
To strike the right balance of quantitative instruction, Pricing Strategy has been struc-
tured to allow latitude in choosing the level of quantitative instruction. The core text in the 
chapters is written at a level appropriate for any student familiar with basic algebra. For 
more advanced students, numerous appendices that require little more than an introduc-
tory level of calculus have been included. 
Pricing is not a static fi eld. New approaches are being developed constantly. It is hoped 
that this book will provide students of pricing with a solid foundation to build upon over 
their careers.

Introduction
A
n executive charged with managing prices must address four fundamental issues: 
(1) What should the price be? (2) When should discounts be granted and how can 
discounts be managed? (3) Will the structure of prices generate the highest profi ts? 
(4) How will competition and industry dynamics infl uence pricing decisions? To address 
these fundamental pricing challenges, we have structured Pricing Strategy into four parts: 
Setting the Price, Managing Price Variances, Establishing Price Structures, and Pricing 
Strategy. 
Part 1: Setting the Price explores quantitative methods for and qualitative infl uences to 
price setting. The three most commonly used quantitative methods for determining list 
prices are exchange value models, economic price optimization, and consumer  perception–
based pricing. Each of these quantitative approaches to setting prices is founded on a 
common philosophical belief, that price should refl ect value. As such, we explore the 
conceptual relationship between price and value directly through both qualitative models. 
 Accepting that value is in the mind of the beholder, we then explore the many psychologi-
cal and behavioral infl uences to the perception of value.
Part 2: Managing Price Variances examines price-discounting decisions. We treat discounts 
as a form of price segmentation, historically known as price discrimination. We begin 
by examining the reasons why a fi rm would grant a discount once they have already 
identifi ed an optimal price, followed by an examination of the profi t, consumer behav-
ior, and organizational challenges created by discounting. To address these challenges, we 
discuss industry-leading accepted methods for monitoring and managing discount deci-
sions. One of these methods for managing discount decisions, volume hurdles arising from 
a profi t-sensitivity analysis, was developed earlier en route to revealing economic price 
optimization.
Part 3: Establishing Price Structures examines six different price structures. There are 
numerous pricing structures and business executives continue to explore new pricing 
structures and variants of historic price structures. We have attempted to focus on the 
most common and effective price structures, though acknowledge that the fi eld is evolv-
ing. Each price structure is examined with respect to consumer behavior, profi t opti-
mization, economic analysis, and key managerial tradeoffs in selecting a specifi c price 
structure. 
One of the oldest pricing structures is two-part pricing, where the purchase of one part 
of the offer enables the purchase of the second part of the offer. Two-part prices are com-
mon in utilities, membership structures, nightclubs, and many other industries.
Oftentimes, fi rms will sell a base product that can be enhanced through the purchase 
of accessories or add-on modules. In Add-ons, Accessories, and Complementary Products, 
we examine the interplay in pricing the base product and potential add-on products.
In contrast to marketing base products and enhancements separately, fi rms can cre-
ate product versions, incrementally improving the benefi ts delivered by the product as 
the product versions improve from good, to better and best. In Versioning, we examine the 
drivers and limitations to versioning price structures.

Introduction
Bundling is another approach to enhancing the benefi ts in an offer. In price bundling, 
two distinct products are sold simultaneously in a single transaction. Bundling creates 
profi ts for the fi rm that are different from other approaches through the effect bundles 
have on customer behavior and the optimization of their pricing structure.
A similar approach to pricing can be found in subscriptions, such as magazines and 
newspapers historically or Software-as-a-Service offers more recently. A key ingredient to 
proper subscription pricing is an understanding of customer lifetime value. 
Alternatively, fi rms can practice dynamic pricing, of which yield management is one 
form. Yield management techniques have come to dominate pricing challenges in the air-
line and hotel industries. 
Part 4: Pricing Strategy places pricing challenges in the context of a larger competitive, 
industry evolution, and legal frameworks.
This book takes an approach of raising decision challenges in pricing and deploying 
quantitative and qualitative models to inform the decision. As the book progresses, new 
models are introduced that build upon those presented earlier in the text. In building mod-
els for informing pricing decisions, we are acknowledging that fl aws are inherent in every 
model and that there are areas in which decisions can be further improved. This is not to 
say that the models are useless, but rather that they are inherently incomplete. 
In this sense, pricing is like physics. Beginning students of physics learn the  Newtonian 
mechanics of force, mass, and acceleration. Although many strong predictions can be 
made, machines designed, and advances achieved from such simple seventeenth-century 
models, Newtonian mechanics began to show its shortcomings as scientists started to 
look more closely at the universe. As a result, in the twentieth century we discovered 
the beauty of quantum mechanics and relativity in explaining the laws of motion in 
greater detail. 
Similarly in pricing, simple models can be constructed that guide executives toward 
better decision making; but like Newtonian mechanics, these simple models only inform 
decisions up to a point. As decision making improves, some of the simpler models must be 
relegated to the position of being merely informative as better models are deployed. 
A new student of pricing may fi nd it unsettling that quantitative approaches fail to 
 deliver clear and fi nal answers. However, pricing is not an engineering challenge, it is a 
strategic challenge. At some point, managers must make decisions in the face of uncer-
tainty. The models presented provide guidance to managerial decision making, informing 
their consequences and potential outcomes of taking one action over another. However, 
a single quantitative model alone is insuffi cient for all pricing decisions. As such, we have 
strived to present a variety of insights and models for pricing, leaving room for managers 
to pick and choose the model that is most applicable to the decision confronting them at 
the time. As George E. P. Box stated, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”

Pricing questions are perhaps the most vexing decisions facing an executive. Few other 
strategic decisions will have a greater impact on the profi tability of the fi rm, the demand 
customers will have for its products, and the latitude that the fi rm will develop to adjust 
its competitive position. Pricing questions span organizational boundaries because of their 
strategic importance, crossing over into marketing, sales, fi nance, and operations. Each 
new functional executive contributing to a pricing decision will add a differing perspective 
that may only complicate the pricing challenge.
To address this challenging strategic decision and manage the competing organizational 
viewpoints, executives need a rational approach to setting prices. They need an approach 
to pricing that is grounded in the realities of the market environment, including issues of 
competition and customer preferences. 
When thinking of prices, it is useful to consider price as the value that the fi rm captures 
in a mutually benefi cial exchange with its customers. The reason for the fi rm’s existence 
is to produce value for its customers in exchange for a price. All profi ts derive from deliv-
ering value to customers at a price that is greater than the cost of producing that value. 
Customers gain value when the benefi ts delivered to them through a product exceed the 
price that they pay for it. 
This exchange is made freely between the fi rm and its customers. In a free market, custom-
ers choose whether or not to purchase a product or service. It is illegal, if not unethical, to 
coerce customer purchases in free and open markets. Even when customers may not like the 
price, they ultimately have the choice to decline the exchange in a free market. Hence, prices 
are the value that the fi rm captures in a mutually benefi cial exchange with its customers.
We begin by demonstrating the impact of pricing and clarifying the challenge of mak-
ing pricing decisions. We demonstrate the construction of an exchange value model as an 
initial means to make rational pricing decisions. Exchange value models reveal the bound-
aries of a good price that a fi rm should use to market a new product. In developing an 
exchange value model, we will reveal the importance of using the customer’s perspective 
of value in pricing decisions.
Informing Price Decisions
THE IMPORTANCE OF PRICE
The importance of setting the right price cannot be understated. Pricing directly af-
fects the profi ts of a fi rm. Even for nonprofi t institutions, pricing decisions affect the 
resources of the fi rm and its ability to serve its constituents. For everyone involved, the 
costs of pricing errors are weighty. Whether the price is too high or too low, pricing 
 errors destroy profi ts. 
When goods and services are priced too high, many customers will refuse to purchase 
them. Not only will the fi rm cede market share to its competitors, but it will relegate itself 
as irrelevant to many potential customers. With few items sold, market traction is forfeited 
and potential and actual investors sour on expectations of fi nancial returns from the fi rm. 
The fi rm will eventually fi nd itself lowering its prices in an effort to regain market atten-
tion, though it may already be too late. Consumer sentiment may turn negative, poten-
tially resulting in public relations challenges and regulatory ramifi cations. 
When goods and services are priced too low, the fi rm will have forgone an important 
opportunity to earn profi t in proportion to the value it is creating for customers. While 
prices are often set low to gain volume, fi rms often discover that the volume is simply not 
there. Moreover, entering a market with an extremely low price will set incorrect price ex-
pectations for the product category. Firms attempting to recover from such a mistake will 
face a headwind of customer expectations for the products to be priced low. In the worst 
case scenario, costs are not covered and the fi rm becomes insolvent.

Chapter 1 
Boundaries of a Good Price
Repeatedly, the wrong price yields lost revenues, lost profi ts, lost customers, and ul-
timately a strategically lost fi rm. There are numerous examples of fi rms executing bad 
pricing decisions. From Motorola’s choice to decrease the price of its revolutionary RAZR 
mobile handset to gain market share to Pilgrim’s Pride’s failure to increase chicken prices 
while chicken feed costs were skyrocketing, bad pricing decisions have had disastrous 
effects. In most cases, not only are profi ts harmed, leading to potential bankruptcy, but 
employees are dismissed and customers switch to more competitive offerings. With insuf-
fi cient profi ts to provide adequate resources to compete, fi rms are unable to invest in pro-
ductivity improvement, much less in developing the next generation of products customers 
will demand. In the end, lost fi rms all too often become irrelevant and die. 
CROSS FUNCTIONAL 
Due to the high importance of pricing, executives will place a huge emphasis on getting 
pricing decisions right. Yet who should make pricing decisions?
From an organizational viewpoint, pricing decisions are a cross-functional challenge 
fraught with discord. Finance, sales and marketing, and even operations executives will 
each be in a position to contribute to pricing decisions. Each of these functional executives 
will bring valuable and unique vantage points and skill sets from which they can draw 
information. Unfortunately, functional executives are likely to be biased by the incentives 
by which their performance is measured. 
Finance executives will likely be highly infl uenced by their accounting orientation in 
addressing pricing decisions. From an informational perspective, they should have a fi rm 
understanding of the costs to produce. With a strong grasp of break-even analysis and 
cost-plus pricing, fi nance executives tend to have a heightened understanding of the rela-
tionship between higher prices and higher profi ts, and in turn, higher shareholder value. 
Given their training and vantage point, fi nance executives frequently argue for higher 
prices and higher contribution margins. However, they are rarely in the best position to 
evaluate whether customers are willing to pay higher prices. 
In contrast, the pricing decisions of sales and marketing executives are likely to be 
highly infl uenced by their customer orientation. From an informational perspective, sales 
and marketing executives are likely to be well informed about market share, competitive 
actions, and customer preferences. Given their training and experience in marketing, they 
are likely to understand both the potential and the limitations that a fi rm has in shaping 
customer preferences and willingness to pay. Sales and marketing executives are often 
rewarded based on their ability to take market share, meet revenue targets, or capture spe-
cifi c customers. Given this incentive bias, sales and marketing executives are unfortunately 
often encouraged to lower prices to grab customers. In the process, they may be forgoing 
opportunities to capture higher profi ts. 
Even operations executives can contribute meaningfully to pricing decisions. Issues 
related to economies of scale, scope, and learning are well within their scope of respon-
sibility and will infl uence pricing decisions. Like other functional executives, operations 
executives make decisions infl uenced by their incentives and performance measurements. 
In this case, performance metrics tied to average cost effi ciencies may encourage opera-
tions executives to seek lower prices to drive up volume and improve capacity utilization. 
In making pricing decisions, executives must take advantage of the benefi ts of the 
 informational resources and skill set of each functional executive while countering the bias 
that each brings to pricing decisions. The needs for unit volume and market share must be 
tempered by the need for contribution margins, and information must be collected across func-
tional boundaries to balance these needs. To make the right decision, many fi rms make pricing 
a chief-executive-level concern due to their breadth of responsibility. To aid their decision, 
many chief executives have developed a new organizational capability: the pricing professional.

Pricing professionals must bring a breadth of insight and skills to pricing decisions. They 
understand how customers perceive offerings and their willingness to pay for them. They also 
have a fi rm grip on issues related to marginal productions costs as well as the fi xed incre-
mental costs related to serving specifi c markets. From a marketing perspective, they will have 
a strong understanding of competitive actions, market share, and industry dynamics. Often, 
they have a deep understanding of economics and are able to both measure the elasticity of 
demand and understand the relationships among price changes, volume changes, and profi t 
improvements. By nature and need, pricing professionals mix hard quantitative analytical 
skills with softer qualitative skills to inform pricing decisions meaningfully and enable action.
Pricing professionals often come from a fi nance, marketing, economics, or mathematical sci-
ence background. Functionally, they typically report to either marketing or fi nance, depending 
on the nature of the pricing challenges they must address daily. For strategic pricing decisions, 
it is increasingly common for pricing professionals to report to the chief executive directly.
IMPACTING PROFITS 
To demonstrate the importance of price, consider the standard profi t equation of a fi rm 
 5 Q ? (P 2 V) 2 F 
Eq. 1.1
where  is used to denote profi t, Q denotes quantity sold, P denotes price, V denotes vari-
able costs, and F denotes fi xed costs. 
To make accurate pricing decisions, we will consistently consider the variable costs to 
be the true marginal costs to produce related to the decision at hand. Many times, when 
fi rms calculate variable costs, they actually calculate average unit costs. Average unit costs 
are not variable costs because they include allocated overhead and other forms of fi xed 
costs in their calculation. As such, average unit costs will decrease if volumes increase, and 
increase if volumes decrease. True marginal costs are the costs to produce one more unit of 
output and are therefore much lower than average unit costs in almost all circumstances. 
While many executives will approximate marginal costs as average unit costs, the result 
is an overly conservative understanding of the true boundaries of profi table prices poten-
tially leading to lost profi t opportunities.
In the profi t equation of the fi rm (Eq. 1.1), all fi xed costs should be captured in the term 
F. Fixed costs include many forms of overhead such as infrastructure (plant and equip-
ment, allocated management, and in some situations, even line staff when labor costs can-
not be truly varied in proportion to output).
Q, representing quantity or volume sold in Equation 1.1, can be measured in the mil-
lions for fi rms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in producing 
silicon chips or McDonald’s in producing hamburgers, or in the single digits for special-
ized industrial products. Similarly, P, standing for price in Equation 1.1, can be measured 
in fractions of a unit of currency or in the millions.1 
If an executive can apply pressure to improve the profi tability of the fi rm by adjusting 
any of the variables in the profi t equation Equation 1.1 (variable costs, fi xed costs, quan-
tity sold, or price), which has the largest impact? To answer this question, let us conduct 
a simple quantitative analysis. 
Suppose that a fi rm operates under the following conditions: Variable costs are $10 for 
each unit of production and fi xed costs are $1 million per quarter. Currently, prices aver-
age $25 per unit and volumes are 80,000 units per quarter. Under these conditions, the 
fi rm earns $200,000 in profi t per quarter. See Exhibit 1-1. 
We can contrast this baseline performance with the outcome achieved by improving 
any one of the profi t levers by 1 percent and holding all else constant. Investing in higher 
productivity to reduce variable costs by 1 percent will improve profi ts by a mere 4 per-
cent. Likewise, reducing overhead or otherwise cutting fi xed costs by 1 percent would

yield 5 percent higher profi ts. If the fi rm were to invest in better marketing to drive vol-
umes up by 1 percent, it would still improve profi ts by only 6 percent. In contrast, increas-
ing prices by 1 percent, either through changes in list prices or reductions in discounts, 
improves profi ts by a whopping 10 percent. 
In comparison to any other variable under management, price has a larger and more 
 immediate impact on profi t than all other levers. The results of this hypothetical fi rm are 
not unique. Researchers have examined the average profi t equation of 1,200 large publicly 
traded fi rms from around the globe and have likewise demonstrated that price changes have 
a larger impact on profi t than any other variable under management control.2
However, the impact of price on the fi rm is a double-edged sword. Just as a small improve-
ment in price delivers a large increase in profi ts, a small degradation in price is highly damaging 
to profi ts. As price has such a signifi cant impact on profi ts, and because it directly infl uences 
customer behavior, it deserves all if not more of the executive attention that it receives.
INFLUENCING PRICE CAPTURE
As the executive-level attention given to pricing indicates and the example profi t lever 
analysis suggests, getting the price right has a signifi cant impact on the fi rm. Yet, these 
observations only underscore the challenge. What is the right price? 
Recalling that price is the value that the fi rm captures in a mutually benefi cial exchange 
with its customers, we discover that the right price is often not a single number, but rather 
a range of potential points that benefi ts both the customer and the fi rm. While some points 
are more benefi cial to the fi rm and others are more benefi cial to its customers, any point 
within this range will mutually benefi t both the fi rm and its customers. Moreover, the price 
that a fi rm gets in the exchange is somewhat under its own infl uence.
For example, consider a simple negotiation exercise concerning Kenyan Coffee that 
I have regularly conducted at DePaul University with both undergraduate and graduate 
students with similar results. Suppose the coffee roaster can deliver Kenyan Coffee at a 
marginal cost of $3.20 per pound. Furthermore, suppose a retailer can resell the Kenyan 
Coffee and earn a profi t so long as he or she buys it for less than $7.50 per pound. Any 
price agreed upon by the sellers and buyers between $3.20 and $7.50 leaves both parties 
better off and is therefore a good price. While lower prices favor the retailer at the expense 
of the roaster, higher prices favor the roaster at the expense of the retailer. However, any 
price within this range delivers a mutually benefi cial exchange.
To arrive at the transaction price, sellers and buyers are asked to negotiate an agree-
ment. In the basic experimental setup, all buyers are directed to purchase Kenyan Coffee 
for less than $7.50. All sellers are directed to sell Kenyan Coffee for more than $3.20, but 
half of the students are told some key selling points regarding Kenyan Coffee and the other

Kenyan Coffee KSPs (Key Selling Points)
Kenyan coffee is among the best, if not the best, coffee grown on the 
planet.
Kenya, the birthplace of coffee beans, is the East African powerhouse 
of the coffee world. Their research and development is unparalleled. 
Their quality control is meticulous. Many thousands of small farmers 
are highly educated, and rewarded, in their agricultural practice for top 
level coffee.
In general, Kenyan coffee is a bright coffee that lights up the palate 
from front to back. A great Kenyan coffee is complex: interesting fruit 
(berry, citrus) fl avors; sometimes alternating with spice; cherished 
winey fl avor.

half are not. Thus, there is a Zone of Potential Agreements, or ZOPA in the negotiations 
literature, between $3.20 and $7.50. See Exhibit 1-2. 
Invariably, sellers who have key selling points and discuss them during the negotia-
tion strike a higher price than those who don’t. In a typical experimental run, the average 
selling price of sellers without key selling points was $3.82, while that of sellers with key 
selling points was $5.33. The key selling points alone enabled sellers to achieve a 40 per-
cent higher transaction price on average in that experimental run. Clearly, price is a profi t 
lever that can be infl uenced. Moreover, it is infl uenced by information. Sellers who are 
informed of the value of their products and can communicate it to their customers are able 
to achieve higher transaction prices than those who are not.
Further investigations into the dynamics of these types of negotiations have demon-
strated that the starting price greatly affects the negotiated price. Sellers who initiate the 
negotiation at a higher price routinely end up at a higher settlement price. Likewise, sellers 
who initiate the negotiation at a lower price routinely end up at a lower settlement price. 
From this more detailed investigation, we learn that negotiations favor aggressive open-
ing bids. Initiating the negotiation at a more favorable price and then slowly ceding price 
concessions enables the negotiator to discover the boundary price of their negotiating 
counterpart and thus settle upon a price that is more favorable. 
In yet a third investigation, Kenyan Coffee buyers and sellers were told the average sell-
ing price of Colombian Coffee. This time, negotiated Kenyan Coffee prices almost always 
converged to a price point similar to that of stated Colombian Coffee. Reference prices 
greatly infl uence transaction prices.
In their entirety, the Kenyan Coffee experiments reveal three very strong prescriptions 
for achieving good prices. One, sellers must be well informed of and aggressively commu-
nicate the value of their products if they hope to achieve a better price. Two, sellers must 
price aggressively and grant discounts from these prices reluctantly. And three, reference 
prices greatly infl uence transaction prices.

Boundaries of a Good Price
THE ART AND SCIENCE OF PRICING
Clearly, pricing is a quantitative fi eld with a direct impact on profi tability. However, as 
the negotiation experiments reveal, pricing is equally a qualitative fi eld where the actions 
of the fi rm affect the price that they can achieve. Good pricing requires a tight connection 
between quantitative and qualitative insights. 
The science of pricing refers to the act of gathering information, conducting quan-
titative analysis, and revealing an accurate understanding of the range of prices likely 
to yield positive results. Pricing data, like any other set of information that infl uences 
executive decisions, is rarely perfectly clear. Not only will there be uncertainties in the 
underlying data, but the appropriate price structure, price point, and price discount 
will vary over time, geography, and customer situation. The time and budget required 
to remove all uncertainty is beyond the patience and resources of almost every fi rm. 
Hence, prices must be set with some uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty, quantitative 
approaches can be used to improve the pricing decision, prevent grievous errors, and 
uncover new opportunities.
As the negotiation experiments demonstrate, the fi rm can take actions to infl uence 
its pricing power in ways that may be diffi cult to analyze using quantitative methods. 
These actions can either be value destroying (such as failing to communicate the value of 
the offering) or value creating (such as uncovering new applications for the offering that 
 improves its value to customers). 
It is important to remember that customers are not a monolithic group to consider 
when setting pricing policy. Some customers will value the product more than others. 
Consequently, the fi rm can price its products higher for some customers than others. Un-
derstanding variations in customer demands uncovers pricing opportunities. 
The art of pricing refers to the ability to infl uence consumer price acceptance, adapt 
pricing structures to shift the competitive playing fi eld, and align pricing strategy to the 
competitive strategy, marketing strategy, and industrial policy. It requires an understand-
ing of consumer behavior and the infl uence of features embedded within the product, the 
perception of value, the expectations of customers, and the price structure itself. It also 
requires that pricing strategy support the fi rm’s marketing strategy in light of the overall 
competitive and industrial environment of the market. 
By taking a more creative approach, fi rms are better able to price in proportion to the 
value that customers perceive. Doing so will combine both quantitative and qualitative 
approaches. In many cases, quantitative approaches will be found to be highly informative 
but lacking in their ability to reveal nuances of customer behavior and therefore opportu-
nities to improve pricing. Qualitative insights enable executives to fi ll these gaps. In doing 
so, executives are able to better align pricing strategy with other strategic decisions. Hence, 
pricing is both an art and a science.
Exchange Value Models
Accepting that the right price lies within some range shifts the challenge of pricing to 
 identifying the boundaries of a good price. Exchange value models quantify the price 
boundaries.3 Knowing the boundaries of a good price narrows pricing discussions to a 
reasonable range of potential price points. 
Using exchange value models to manage pricing decisions shifts pricing challenges from 
the position of managing internal corporate politics or copying historic practices that may 
have little bearing on the challenge at hand, to one of focusing on the value created and 
the fi rm’s ability to capture its fair share of that value.
Two sets of boundaries are uncovered from exchange value models. The extreme 
boundaries defi ne the range of acceptable prices outside of which no rational buyer or

seller would ever transact. The narrower boundaries which lie within these extremes de-
fi ne the range of prices that are most likely to encourage customer transactions and leave 
the fi rm in the most favorable position. While buyers and sellers will sometimes transact 
outside these narrower boundaries, it is not usually in their best interest to do so.
To illustrate the boundaries of a good price, we will examine the release of the Cypher 
drug eluting stent by Cordis, a Johnson & Johnson Company, in April 2003.4 Stents are 
used to reopen clogged arteries leading to the heart after plaque has narrowed the passage 
and restricted blood fl ow. Prior to its release, the best alternative was a standard metal-
lic stent made by a number of competitors. In mechanical construction, the Cypher drug 
eluting stent was similar. In laboratory tests, the addition of a pharmaceutical formulary 
coating the standard metallic stent was demonstrated to improve the patient’s body’s abil-
ity to accept the stent within the artery. With the unique addition of a patented formulary 
that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Cypher was a revo-
lutionary new product when launched. No other product of its kind had been marketed. 
As such, Cordis executives could not simply copy a competitor’s practices in pricing it. 
Rather, pricing would be a particularly daunting challenge for these executives.
To price a revolutionary product like Cypher, executives can construct an exchange 
value model. Exchange value models inform executives of the relative value that their 
product delivers to customers and therefore enables executives to price in proportion to 
its perceived value. For revolutionary products, exchange value models are a commonly 
used best-practice approach to identifying launch prices. Once an exchange value model 
has been used to set prices, it can then be repurposed as a sales tool to support the com-
munication of value. As such, exchange value models are an important quantitative tool 
for setting prices and infl uencing price acceptance. 
EXTREME BOUNDARIES 
At the extremes, the price should lie between the marginal cost to produce and the full 
consumer utility. Any transaction outside these extremes would leave the seller or buyer 
worse off after the transaction than before, and therefore it cannot be expected to occur 
between rational buyers and sellers.
Marginal Costs Deﬁ ne the Extreme Lower Boundary
Marginal costs constitute the seller’s bottom line. Any price below marginal costs leaves 
the seller worse off than it would have been without the transaction. Any price above it 
leaves the seller better off. At times, sellers may choose to price very near marginal costs 
for tactical price purposes, but in general, sellers will seek to profi t from their transactions. 
Failure to profi t from transactions removes any motivation to participate in the trade; 
hence executives cannot be expected to price at this level. 
Estimates vary widely on the marginal cost to produce Cypher and it is diffi cult to 
pierce the corporate veil to identify the true marginal costs. Some reports indicate that 
standard metal stents had an average unit cost near $150 at the time of launching  Cypher. 
Coating a stent with pharmaceuticals is not an expensive challenge, and manufacturing 
the pharmaceuticals should add only a few dollars per stent. That said, some estimates 
indicate that Cypher had a fully loaded average unit cost of $375 at the time of its launch. 
While fully loaded average unit costs are likely to be much higher than marginal costs, we 
will accept this fi gure as a gross approximation of the true marginal costs of production 
for the sake of demonstrating an exchange value model. 
Regardless of how low the true marginal costs are, Cordis should not price Cypher 
anywhere near this level. It would not be a fair exchange to expect Cordis to price the drug 
eluting stent near marginal cost. Developing Cypher required a tremendous amount of re-
search and development—a risky investment made with the expectation of lofty rewards.

Chapter 1 
Boundaries of a Good Price
Not only should the fi rm desire prices to cover the investment costs of developing Cypher, 
but it should also seek to gain profi ts, which are necessary not only to reward investors, 
but also to invest in further research and development leading to the creation of new 
products that will be valued by consumers in the future. Furthermore, even after being 
fi rst to market with a drug eluting stent, Cordis faces a business risk that other research 
and development efforts will develop new solutions for coronary heart disease long before 
the patent on Cypher has expired. Rather than using marginal costs as a guide to making 
pricing decisions, therefore, the executives of Cypher are better off using them as a bright 
line below which prices should not fall.
Marginal costs are simply a lower boundary on prices. They provide little guidance to 
what the price should be, outside of stating that the price should not be below this level. 
Importantly, internal cost accounting considerations of marginal costs fail to incorporate 
the value that the product delivers to customers. Without connecting the price to the value 
that the product delivers, sellers have little insight into their pricing potential. Failing to 
understand value from the customer’s perspective may tempt executives to price very high 
to recover sunk costs or opportunistically profi t from uninformed customers, yet doing 
so will quickly make the fi rm irrelevant to the market as customers refuse to purchase. 
Or, equally pernicious and far more prevalent, the failure to understand the customer’s 
perspective of value leaves the seller to cleave to its marginal costs and price a new prod-
uct too low, denying the fi rm its well-deserved reward for the hard work that it takes to 
develop a new product and deliver its value to customers. As we saw in the negotiation 
experiment, marginal costs are simply one of two extreme boundaries. 
Consumer Utility Deﬁ nes the Extreme Upper Boundary
If marginal costs are the seller’s bottom line, customer utility is the buyer’s bottom line. The 
customer utility is the value a customer gains from having the product. All customers would 
be worse off after a transaction if they paid more for the product than they gained in utility, 
and they would be better off if they paid less for the product than they gained in utility. The 
value that buyers place on a product is the utility that they derive from the product. The 
consumer surplus is the difference between the overall customer utility and the transaction 
price. So long as the consumer surplus is positive, customers will value the product.
Customers gain utility from a product directly from the benefi ts that the product deliv-
ers. These benefi ts have been categorized into four fundamental types. Form utility derives 
directly from the intrinsic properties of the product itself, such as the value that customers 
place on extending their lives with a stent, the enjoyment that customers experience when 
drinking a tasty beverage, or the production value of a turbine to an electricity merchant 
generator. Place utility derives from the ability to acquire the product in a desired location, 
such as having the stent available at a nearby hospital, drinking the beverage at a local 
cafe, or receiving the turbine at the merchant generator’s power plant. Time utility derives 
from the ability to access the product at a convenient moment, such as receiving the stent 
when coronary heart disease has been detected, drinking the beverage when thirsty, or get-
ting the turbine at the right time in the construction process of the merchant generator’s 
power plant. Ownership utility is gained from possessing the rights to the value of the 
product even if the possession is never actually taken, such as the value of insurance cover-
age that would pay for the implant of the stent when and if needed, the value of holding 
a beverage which can either be drunk or resold, or the value of holding rights to a turbine 
to be delivered in the future. 
While customers derive utility from an improved stent from all four fundamental types, 
in pricing Cypher, Cordis should focus on the form utility. The most signifi cant value cre-
ated in producing Cypher is that which is most closely related to the value that customers 
gain in extending their lives. Yet, what is the value of extending life?

Life is exactly what is at stake with coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease 
increases the strain on the heart and deprives the heart of the oxygen and blood fl ow that 
it needs to function properly. Without corrective action, patients suffering from coronary 
heart disease will have a much reduced life expectancy, an increased likelihood of a heart 
attack, and potentially sudden death. 
Economists have attempted to quantify the value of a life. In a somewhat accepted 
although ethically questionable practice, economists often value a life as the present value 
of the future lifetime earnings. Not only does this approach fail to adequately consider 
potential career changes during a person’s lifetime, but more importantly, it is a woefully 
inaccurate calculation of the value that individuals place on their lives. It doesn’t begin to 
capture the value that people attach to spending more time with their spouse, seeing their 
children and grandchildren mature, attending the weddings and baby showers of loved 
ones, or being able to accomplish one more lifetime goal. Put in these terms, we quickly 
understand why many philosophers will argue that all life is equally valuable and perhaps 
immeasurable.
As with many decisions in pricing, we must accept our inability to perfectly quantify 
everything and rather work with the best estimates and commonly accepted practices that 
we have. As such, let us estimate the value that people place on their lives as the present 
value of future earnings. In addition, while the wages and duration of future productivity 
vary between individuals, let us estimate that the present value of the lifetime earnings of 
a coronary heart disease patient is $500,000 on average. 
No doubt, many readers will argue that that is a ridiculously low value for a person’s 
life. However, if the customer utility of a stent is near $500,000, should Cordis launch 
Cypher near this level? Quickly we realize that such a price would be absurd. If Cordis 
did price Cypher anywhere near this level, most customers would fi nd it unattainable. 
Moreover, customer sentiment would likely sour on Cordis, leading to retaliation, claims 
of unfair pricing practices, and protests that Cordis was charging too much or that Cordis 
was only serving the rich elite. In such an environment, governments might force Cordis to 
forgo its patents and allow other fi rms to produce copycat products. Clearly, pricing near 
the customer’s utility is not a very informed or advisable approach. 
Customer utility is simply an upper boundary on prices. It provides little guidance 
to what the price should be outside of stating that the price should be below this level. 
Customer utility is the mirror image of marginal costs. Just as fi rms should avoid pricing 
near marginal costs, customers should avoid accepting prices near customer utility. As we 
saw with the negotiation experiment, customer utility is simply the second of two extreme 
boundaries.
Marginal Costs and Customer Utility Are the Extremes
At this point, we have examined two of the most discussed issues related to pricing in any 
introductory economics textbook. What they reveal is that marginal costs are the seller’s 
bottom line (and hence the lower extreme boundary on the potential price), and that 
customer utility is the buyer’s bottom line (and hence the upper extreme boundary on the 
potential price). Neither reveals the right price by itself, but combined, they reveal the hard 
boundaries of potential price one might, in one’s wildest dreams, imagine for launching 
Cypher. 
Unfortunately, the range of prices between these boundaries is quite wide. Conserva-
tively estimating marginal costs at $375 and customer utility at $500,000 leaves a range of 
potential prices that is far too wide for any meaningful decision making. The two extreme 
boundaries are separated by more than a factor of 1,000. Even for physicists, stating that 
some physical value lies somewhere within a factor of 1,000 is of little use in all but the 
most advanced astronomy or particle physics research questions. From these boundaries,

Chapter 1 
Boundaries of a Good Price
Cordis executives would be unsure if the launch price of Cypher should be $400, $4,000, 
$40,000, or $400,000.
Executives need a tighter set of boundaries than those provided by marginal costs and 
customer utility for pricing decisions. Even reducing the dispersion of potential prices to 
a single factor of 10 would be far more useful than that developed by considering the ex-
treme boundaries alone. For a revolutionary product, executives may accept reluctantly a 
somewhat broad range of a factor of 10 but will give no credence to a method that leaves 
three orders of magnitude in uncertainty. For more evolutionary products, they are likely 
to demand pricing guidance that narrows the range to within a few percentage points. 
NARROWER BOUNDARIES
Executives looking for guidance in pricing decisions clearly need a narrower and more rel-
evant set of boundaries than those identifi ed by considering marginal costs and customer 
utility. To identify these boundaries, we need to think strategically about prices.
As the discussion on customer utility reveals, products are valued because they enable a 
customer to do something. Customers value products because they enable them to accom-
plish a goal. Prior to the launch of a new product, customers have usually found alterna-
tive ways to accomplish the same or similar goals. No product enters a complete vacuum. 
Life doesn’t start with the introduction of a new product, but it may get better. After the 
launch of a new product, customers can accomplish their goals easier. 
Rather than painstakingly quantifying the full and accurate value of accomplishing a 
goal, the more relevant question is, What is the value of accomplishing that goal in the 
presence of the new product compared to its absence? That is, what are the alternative 
means to accomplishing a goal? What is the price of these alternatives? How much more 
value is created by accomplishing that goal with the new product? What other goals can 
be accomplished with the new product that were diffi cult to accomplish before?
Strategically, prices should refl ect the value to customers of accomplishing their goals 
in comparison to alternative means. Higher prices refl ect the ability of a product to fulfi ll 
a need better than the alternatives. Lower prices refl ect the ability of a product to fulfi ll 
a subset of the needs as well as the alternatives. This is the nature of strategic pricing: to 
price in proportion to the value delivered in light of the comparable alternatives. 
The narrower price boundaries are defi ned by the comparable alternatives and differ-
ential value.

Comparable alternatives are solutions that customers may have to accomplish the same 
or a similar set of goals. They may be directly competitive offers or indirect substitute 
solutions to the challenges facing customers. Competing alternatives can usually be identi-
fi ed within the marketplace and will have an existing transaction price. As such, they can 
 inform the pricing decision.
For Cordis, the nearest comparable offer to the Cypher drug eluting stent was the stan-
dard metal stent. The standard metal stent was not a perfect solution to coronary heart 
disease. Roughly 25 percent of the patients who received the standard metal stent suffered 
from the complication of restenosis, or reclogging of the artery. Clinical trials demon-
strated that Cypher reduced the probability of restenosis to around 5 percent. Hence, the 
Cypher drug eluting stent was a superior alternative to the existing products on the market 
at the time of its release.
Comparable alternatives are sometimes more challenging to identify, but they will al-
ways exist. For revolutionary products, the comparable alternative is usually a substi-
tute offer. For instance, prior to the introduction of the Internet in the 1990s, there were 
postal services, billboards, telephone books, telephones, newspapers, magazines, radio,

and television. Prior to the introduction of the desktop computer in the 1980s, there were 
typewriters, calculators, and cellulose slides. And, prior to the railroad of the 1800s, peo-
ple walked, rode horses, and travelled in stagecoaches.  
There are more distant comparable alternatives to Cypher. Before the development of 
the metal stent, patients suffering from coronary heart disease would often be treated with 
cardiac bypass surgery. Cardiac bypass surgery is only one of the substitute solutions on 
the market. Other substitute solutions might include pharmaceuticals, bed rest, and the 
directive to change one’s eating habits and exercise regimens. 
In formulating pricing guidance, it is best to use the most closely comparable offer on 
the market. Customers are more likely to evaluate their willingness to pay in relationship 
with a closely comparable solution than they are with some distant alternative. As such, 
executives should use the closest competing or substitute solution when identifying poten-
tial price points.
At the time of launching Cypher, the standard metal stent was the most common, ef-
fective, and cost-effi cient approach to addressing coronary heart disease. Therefore, the 
standard metal stent will be the basis for creating our narrower price boundaries. The 
standard metal stent is clearly an inferior alternative to Cypher because it is associated 
with a higher rate of restenosis. 
Inferior alternatives are any competing alternatives that deliver similar benefi ts to the 
one under consideration with less overall consumer utility. Inferior alternatives defi ne the 
narrow lower bound for pricing decisions. 
This narrow lower boundary is a soft lower boundary. In general, executives should 
price products higher than their next nearest inferior alternative because their new prod-
uct will deliver more value. In some cases, executives may price below this boundary if 
they expect to tap into a new market that was inaccessible with existing offers at their 
current prices. When they do so, they must still price above the hard lower boundary set 
by marginal costs. In general, though, pricing below an inferior alternative implies the fi rm 
is forgoing some profi t potential. 
Cordis produced a standard metal stent priced at roughly $1,050 prior to its launch of 
Cypher.5 Using this data point to guide a pricing decision and the fact that the Cypher drug 
eluting stent is superior to a standard metal stent implies that Cypher should be priced at 
or above this level. But how much higher? To determine how much higher to price Cypher 
than the standard metal stent, we need to determine the value of its superiority. 
Differential Value
Differential value is the change in customer utility that a product delivers in comparison 
to the alternative. If the new product is superior to its comparable alternatives, the dif-
ferential value is positive. If the new product is inferior to its comparable alternatives, the 
differential value is negative. 
The economic exchange value of a product is the price of the nearest comparable al-
ternative adjusted for the differential value of the product. (Eq. 1.2) It is the price that 
customers would pay for its nearest comparable offer plus the value of the increased (or 
decreased) benefi ts of the improved (or degraded) new product. 
Exchange Value 5 Price of Comparable Alternative 1 Differential Value Eq. 1.2
For a given product, rational customers should be willing to pay any price up to that 
 determined by the exchange value. Hence, the exchange value is the upper narrow bound-
ary on price for products superior to their nearest comparable alternative. 
A new product priced at the exchange value would, on average, leave customers indif-
ferent between the new product and the nearest comparable alternative. Some customers 
may value the new product more and thus be willing to pay more, while others will value

it less. Thus, the exchange value is a soft upper bound on the narrower range of poten-
tial prices. Executives may price higher than the exchange value but usually fi nd it more 
benefi cial to price slightly lower. Any price below the exchange value will, on average, 
leave customers better off with the new product than they would be with its comparable 
alternatives, and defi nitely better off than they would be without the product at all, and 
therefore would be a good price.
To quantify the differential value, we must create a model. As with any model devel-
oped within the timescale of human existence, it will be incomplete. Yet the model will 
provide executives with better quality information than they would achieve in its absence, 
and therefore it will be highly useful for providing pricing guidance.
To construct a model of the differential value of a new product to its comparable 
alternative, executives should attempt to quantify the value of the change in benefits. 
One of the more useful approaches is to conduct an “as is” and “to be” description 
of the situation. The “as is” description elucidates the current means that a customer 
will use to achieve a goal with the current comparable alternatives, the value of that 
approach, and its shortcomings. The “to be” description elucidates the future means 
that a customer will use to achieve a goal with the new product, the value of that 
 approach, and its shortcomings. 
The specific quantitative model that will describe the benefits will change depend-
ing on the nature of the benefits. In creating the model, pricing professionals will 
demonstrate some artistic license in their quantitative analysis. No single model cap-
tures the value of every type of benefit. Time savings, labor savings, asset utilization 
improvements, revenue capture improvements, risk reductions, enjoyment improve-
ments, health improvements, and many other types of benefits can be quantitatively 
modeled to some degree. The best quantitative model that describes the value of the 
benefits and the change in value will depend upon the nature of the pricing challenge 
at hand.6
Cypher clearly delivers more benefi ts than standard metal stents to cardiac care pa-
tients; therefore, we should expect the differential value to be positive. In comparison to 
the standard metal stent, the major increase in benefi ts comes from the reduction in the 
rate of restenosis. As a starting point for providing pricing guidance, we will model the 
differential value created by reducing the rate of restenosis.
Stents are not used in isolation but rather as a component of a larger procedure. To im-
plant a stent and relieve some of the challenges created by coronary heart disease, patients 
must undergo surgery. The price of the operation, including the hospital stay, operating 
room costs, doctors, nurses, postsurgery hospital monitoring, and other components can 
be estimated at $12,000.7 
Of the total operation price, the standard metal stent is only a $1,050 component. 
If a procedure fails 25 percent of the time when a standard metal stent is implanted, 
we can expect that the cost of failure to be equal to, if not greater than, the cost of the 
original stent implantation. When restenosis occurs, doctors must address the issue with 
pharmaceuticals, angioplasty, a second implant, and perhaps even cardiac bypass sur-
gery. We can use these insights to estimate the differential value of a drug eluting stent 
such as Cypher.
To construct a model of the differential value, let us fi rst calculate the expected total 
costs of using a standard metal stent using a probability tree. According to the data col-
lected, we know that patients undergoing a metal stent implantation must pay the initial 
$12,000 surgery price 100 percent of the time; 25 percent of the time, we believe they 
must pay a similar $12,000 price to rectify the challenge of restenosis; and 75 percent 
of the time, no further action is required and the patients can return to their normal life. 
Using these insights, we can calculate the expected total cost of using a standard metal 
stent to be $15,000. See Exhibit 1-3.

To calculate the differential value of Cypher in comparison to a standard metal stent, we can 
repeat the calculation after adjusting for the change in the rate of restenosis using the price of 
the stent as an unknown while holding the expected total cost constant. In this case, the total 
expected cost is still $15,000. We use the same total expected cost because we are attempting to 
identify the price of Cypher that will leave customers indifferent between the new product and 
its nearest comparable alternative. We have identifi ed the price of a single surgical implant pro-
cedure with a standard metal stent at $12,000, of which the standard metal stent constitutes 
$1,050. Thus, the cost of the procedure not including the choice of stent is $10,950 ($10,950  
$12,000  $1,050. Because we don’t know the potential price of the drug eluting stent, let this 
be the unknown that we are trying to solve for and denote it with X in Exhibit 1-4. 
After a little algebra, the probability tree analysis reveals the exchange value of the drug 
eluting stent to be $3,340. If the exchange value is $3,340 and the comparable  alternative 
is priced at $1,050, we can calculate the differential value to be $2,290 ($2,290 5 
$3,340 2 $1,050).

This model does not include many of the other sources of value delivered by the cre-
ation of a drug eluting stent. The value of lost time to the patient in repeating the pro-
cedure, the peace of mind in reducing the potential that the operation will fail, and the 
reduction in risk of death are all signifi cant sources of value. Customers may be willing to 
pay much more than the calculated exchange value for a drug eluting stent based on these 
more personal issues. On a purely economic basis, we can feel confi dent that the exchange 
value calculated is therefore a reasonable, if not conservative, estimate of the potential 
price of Cypher.
PRICING IN PROPORTION TO VALUE 
From the hard extreme boundaries, we know that Cordis must price Cypher between the 
marginal costs of $375 and the customer utility estimated to be $500,000. From the softer 
narrow boundaries, we suspect that Cordis should price Cypher higher than its near-
est comparable alternative at $1,050 because it will deliver more value. From a simple 
exchange value model, we suspect that any price below $3,340 should be appealing. See 
Exhibit 1-5.
By strategically considering comparable alternatives and their differential value to 
calculate the exchange value, we have reduced our uncertainty in pricing from a factor 
greater than 1,000 to something closer to 3. Clearly, exchange value models grounded in 
considerations of comparable alternatives and differential value are far more useful for 
providing pricing guidance than simple considerations of marginal costs or customer util-
ity. In fact, for many pricing decisions, marginal costs and customer utility have relatively 
little use in setting prices. Identifying competing products and substitutes and understand-
ing why customers will judge them to be inferior or superior is a far more accurate ap-
proach to pricing.

At what price did Cordis executives release Cypher? As a compromise to the needs of 
insurers and government bodies and the needs of the fi rm, Cypher was released with a list 
price of $3,195.8 
At $3,195, Cypher was priced much higher than its marginal costs and much lower 
than the consumer utility delivered. Likewise, $3,195 is higher than Cypher’s nearest com-
parable inferior alternative and lower than its exchange value. 
Priced at $3,195, Cypher was roughly three times the price of its competitors. Did cus-
tomers balk at this new price? Not at all. In the nine months after its release, the Cypher 
stent raised Cordis’s market share from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent in 
the U.S. market.9,10 
Financially, Cypher was a runaway success for Cordis, earning the fi rm billions of dol-
lars. Clearly, pricing anywhere near marginal costs would have forfeited a tremendous 
profi t opportunity, reducing the required income to continue developing blockbuster in-
novations. At the opposite boundary, researchers have examined the pricing decisions of 
highly successful entrepreneurs and found they tend to price as near to the exchange value 
as possible, much as the executives of Cordis did with Cypher.11
The release price of Cypher represents an acceptable compromise of the needs of Cor-
dis, insurance companies, and governmental bodies. At this price, the circle of stakeholders 
has been improved. Investors are rewarded for their risk taking. Employees are rewarded 
for contributing the talents and initiative to developing new solutions to customer needs 
by continued employment and potentially bonuses. Finally, not only do customers have 
a slightly more cost-effective treatment of coronary heart disease, but patients can be 
 expected to enjoy longer, healthier lives. 
Setting Prices
For revolutionary products like Cypher, exchange value models have proven to be highly cost-
effective and time-effi cient means of determining the boundaries of a good price. Executives 
are plagued with a dearth of information and customers lack the insight necessary to make 
informed comments about pricing decisions for revolutionary products. As such, exchange 
value calculators create clarity in an otherwise informational abyss. The form of the exchange 
value model will change depending on the benefi ts delivered by the product, yet the overall 
approach of identifying comparable alternatives, understanding the differences in benefi ts, and 
calculating the differential value can be repeated for almost any pricing challenge.
For more evolutionary products or even mature commodity products, exchange value 
models fail to provide a suffi ciently narrow range of prices for decision making. With these 
types of products, research-based techniques that more directly measure customer prefer-
ences and other economic factors are required.
In all cases, the range of a good price is bound at the extremes between marginal costs 
and consumer surplus, and bound in a narrower sense by the exchange value determined 
by comparable alternatives adjusted for its differential value. A price that lies within these 
boundaries will leave all stakeholders better off, and that is the mark of a good price.
Summary
• Pricing is a strategic challenge with a direct impact on profi tability. It requires a 
breadth of information and the right perspective, as well as the ability to balance 
competing agendas. 
• The science of pricing refers to the act of gathering information, conducting 
quantitative analysis, and revealing an accurate understanding of the range of 
prices likely to yield positive results.

Chapter 1 
Boundaries of a Good Price
• The art of pricing refers to the ability to infl uence consumer price acceptance, 
adapt pricing structures to shift the competitive playing fi eld, and align pricing 
strategy to the competitive strategy, marketing strategy, and industrial policy. 
• Good prices are those that leave both the fi rm and its customers better after the 
transaction than before. The extreme range of good prices is bound by marginal 
costs from below and customer utility from above. A narrower range of prices is 
bound by the price of the nearest inferior alternative from below and the exchange 
value from above.
• Differential value is quantifi ed from the increase or decrease in benefi ts delivered 
by the product under investigation in comparison to those delivered by the 
comparable alternative.
• The exchange value is the price of the comparable alternative plus the differential 
value.
• For revolutionary products, simple exchange value models are often the most 
effi cient means of quantifying the boundaries of a good price.
• Equipped with quantifi ed price boundaries, executives are able to combine their 
desire for profi ts with an understanding of the value that they deliver to customers 
to make better pricing decisions.

 7. In the 1990s, Itron introduced new automatic meter reading (AMR) solutions to 
the North American utility market. AMR was a revolutionary product in the 1990s 
that completely changed the challenge of reading electric meters. Prior to AMR 
products, utilities were forced to read meters manually, at a cost of approximately 
$1 per meter read. After the release of AMR products, the cost of reading a meter 
went to roughly zero. Utilities faced steep switching costs for adopting AMR over 
manual meter reading methods. Installing an AMR module required a skilled 
technician to visit each home individually. Assume the cost to install an AMR 
solution is $50 per meter. For the sake of this exercise, assume the above estimates 
are accurate and the marginal cost to produce an AMR module is $12.
 a. What is the annual cost per meter to a utility for manual meter reading? For 
AMR?
 b. Assume that utilities use a 6 percent discount rate to evaluate new purchases. 
Over the 10-year life span of an AMR solution, what are the cost savings per 
meter?

 d. What is the differential value of AMR to its nearest comparable alternative?

hour, a customer can borrow a car. (The price includes all fuel, insurance, taxes, 
and car usage fees.) In contrast, the average American spends $3,000 per year in 
car payments and service, $2,000 per year for fuel, and $1,000 per year for car 
insurance and taxes.
 a. What is the total annual cost of car ownership for the average American?
 b. Consider an urban resident who uses a car 6 hours a week. What is the annual 
cost of Zipcar usage?
 c. Consider a suburban resident who uses a car 50 hours a week. What is the 
annual cost of Zipcar usage?
 d. Can Zipcar attract both urban and suburban residents given its current price 
structure? Who is Zipcar’s primary target market?
Inferior Goods
Assumed in the evaluation of the boundaries of a good price was that the nearest com-
parable alternative was, in some way, inferior. Often, however, the existing comparable 
alternatives are superior. When the existing products are superior to the new product, the 
approach to identifying the boundaries of a good price must be slightly altered. 
Inferior products are developed and marketed routinely. In construction, some of the 
features and benefi ts of existing products are removed to make a cheaper alternative. For-
tunes have been made by stripping out unnecessary benefi ts to deliver the product desired 
by customers, so it is worthwhile to consider the boundaries of a good price for these 
products as well.
The analysis of the boundaries is somewhat similar in the case of marketing an infe-
rior good as it is in the case of marketing a superior good. The key difference is that the

Profit’s Sensitivity to Price
sales volume and prices, executives can identify the profi t sensitivity to price changes and 
optimize prices.
Economic price optimization is useful in some markets. Unlike the broad range of 
prices developed from exchange value models, economic price optimization can provide 
price guidance down to a fraction of a cent. In markets for mature, commonly purchased 
products such as milk, fuel, chickens, and iron ore, customers will switch suppliers to cap-
ture even the slightest price break. To capture and retain customers, executives need the 
higher level of accuracy provided through economic price optimization than that provided 
through exchange value models.
Despite the apparent ability of economic price optimization to pinpoint a price, it is 
not appropriate for all pricing decisions. Economic price optimization requires a highly 
accurate understanding of the relationship between prices and demand. One of the key 
differences between revolutionary products and more mature products is the availability of 
relevant information regarding the customer’s response to price changes. In revolutionary 
markets, the product will have very little track record from which to quantify the customer 
response to price changes. In more mature markets, research and statistical approaches 
may reveal an accurate relationship between prices and demand.
A profi t sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact of a small change in price on 
profi ts. Price changes have both direct and indirect effects on profi ts. The direct effect is 
seen in linear relationship between profi ts and prices. The indirect effect derives from the 
infl uence of price changes on customer demand. In normal markets, higher prices lead to 
fewer purchases and lower prices lead to greater purchases.1 Because profi t depends on the 
quantity sold as well as price, and the quantity sold itself depends on prices, price changes 
indirectly affect profi ts through their infl uence on demand.
From the profi t sensitivity analysis, we can uncover volume hurdles. Volume hurdles
defi ne the required demand increase to justify a price cut and the allowable demand sacrifi ce 
to justify a price hike. In strategic decisions to attack a specifi c market at a new price point, 
volume hurdles enable executives to quantify the required selling goals and compare them 
against their expectations of potential demand. In tactical pricing decisions, volume hurdles 
are a routine procedure in setting sales targets for price promotions and discount practices 
and for evaluating the profi tability of price concessions at the end of the promotion. 
The profi t sensitivity analysis also lays the foundation for conducting economic price 
optimization. Economic price optimization is a method of identifying the price that maxi-
mizes profi ts. It will rely on quantifying the elasticity of demand, a measure of the relation-
ship between price changes and sales volume. 
In this chapter, we continue our exploration of rational approaches to setting prices 
and managing price decisions. First, we conduct a profi t sensitivity analysis to construct 
volume hurdles. In doing so, we will highlight the importance of understanding the rela-
tionship between prices and demand leading to an exploration of elasticity of demand. 
With an understanding of the elasticity of demand, executives are in a position to conduct 
economic price optimization and understand profi t’s sensitivity to price. 
Proﬁ t Sensitivity Analysis
A profi t sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of a small price change on profi tability. It 
is a straightforward analysis of the expected profi ts earned at two different prices. With a 
profi t sensitivity analysis, we can compare the expected profi ts to be earned at the current 
price against those which may be earned at a different price.2
Returning to our standard profi t equation of a fi rm, we can see that price directly
affects profi ts. Less obvious are the effects of prices through the other variables in the 
profi t equation. Recall that

where p, the Greek letter pi, denotes profi t, Q denotes quantity sold, P denotes price,
V denotes variable costs, and F denotes fi xed costs.
Among the variables that determine profi t, a pure price change infl uences the quantity sold 
but not the variable and fi xed costs. For normal goods, price increases are associated with 
volume decreases and price decreases are associated with volume increases. Statistically, one 
would state that the price and quantity sold are negatively correlated in normal markets. A 
pure price change implies that the price increases or decreases without changing the product. 
Because the product itself isn’t affected, it can be anticipated that the means of production, 
and therefore the variable and fi xed costs, should not be affected by a pure price change. 
To identify profi t’s sensitivity to price, let us compare the expected profi t earned at the 
current price against the profi t that may be earned at the future new price under consid-
eration. Using pi to denote the profi ts earned at the initial prices and pf to denote the 
expected profi ts to be earned at the fi nal price, we fi nd from Equation 2.1 that 
 p i 5  Q i ? ( P i 2 V) 2 F 
Eq. 2.2a
 p f 5  Q f ? ( P f 2 V) 2 F 
Eq. 2.2b
where Pi identifi es the initial prices and Pf identifi es the fi nal price under consideration. 
Similarly, we denote the initial quantity sold with Qi and the quantity that will be sold 
at the new price with Qf . Variable and fi xed costs are constant with respect to pure price 
changes; hence they do not vary between Equations 2.2a and 2.2b.
VOLUME HURDLES
Volume hurdles result from the requirement for price changes to leave the fi rm better off,
if not at least as well off, after the price change than it was before. Based on the profi t 
 motive of the fi rm, we can state the requirement of price changes to improve profi ts as 
pf $ pi 
Eq. 2.3
Algebraic Analysis
Using Equations 2.2a and 2.2b and the requirement that any price change should improve 
profi ts in Equation 2.3, we can derive algebraically the required change in volume to 
deliver equal or higher profi ts from a price change. The resulting inequality defi nes the 
volume hurdle, or the minimum change in volume to associate with a change in price to 
improve profi ts:

Chapter 2 
Profit’s Sensitivity to Price
In accordance with the profi t motive of the fi rm, the objective of any price change is 
simply to improve profi tability. If the fi rm expects the volume hurdle to be met, then a 
price change may be in order. If the volume hurdle is greater than the expected change 
in sales, then the new price cannot be justifi ed and the fi rm should consider alternative 
actions.
Graphical Analysis
With a graphical analysis, we can see that the volume hurdle results from requiring profi t 
contributions gained through increases in volume at a lower price to be greater than those 
lost by the price reduction. See Exhibit 2-1. 
The revenue gained at a given price is the area of a rectangle given by P 3 Q. The profi t 
contribution at a given price is the area of a smaller rectangle given by (P 2 V) 3 Q. As 
before, a price change should be executed only if, at a minimum, the new price improves 
profi ts.
If G is the profi t contribution gained through volume increases at a reduced price, and 
L is the profi t contribution lost through the price reduction, the profi t motive of the fi rm 
requires gains to be greater than losses, or 
G $ L 
Eq. 2.6
The profi t contribution gained, G, is the area of the rectangle defi ned by the change in 
volume multiplied by the new contribution margin. The profi t contribution lost, L, is the 
area of the rectangle defi ned by the change price multiplied by the old volume. Mathemati-
cally, we can state this as
G ; (Pf 2 V) ? (Qf 2 Qi)  
Eq. 2.7a
L ; (Pi 2 Pf ) ? Qi 
Eq. 2.7b
Inserting Equations 2.7a and 2.7b, which quantify the expected losses and gains, into 
Equation 2.6, which requires that gains should be greater than losses, we fi nd that
(Pf 2 V) ? (Qf 2 Qi) $ (Pi 2 Pf ) ? Qi

DECISION IMPLICATIONS
Executives can use the volume hurdle in considering either price increases or decreases 
before the price change has occurred. All the variables that defi ne the volume hurdle in 
Equation 2.4 can be quantifi ed with information internal to the fi rm. The current price 
and variable costs are all facts that executives can identify from their internal account-
ing records. The proposed price is up to the management’s discretion. The result is a 
requirement on the change in volume associated with the chosen change in price. If the 
expected change in volume is greater than that predicted by the volume hurdle, then 
a price change may be in order. If not, then the price change will damage profi ts and 
should be averted.
For price reductions, the percent change in price, %DP, is negative, and therefore
the right side of Equation 2.4 will be positive. This implies that the volume hurdle, 
%DQ, will be positive, or that volumes are required to increase if prices are reduced 
for the fi rm to profi t from the price move. If the expected increase in volume associated 
with the price reduction under consideration will overcome the volume hurdle, the price 
reduction is predicted to improve profi tability. If not, the price reduction is predicted to 
harm profi tability. 
Volume hurdles can also be created for considering price increases. For price increases, 
the percent change in price, %DP, is positive and therefore the right side of Equation 2.4 
will be negative. In this case, the inequality will allow the change in volume, %DQ, to 
be negative. That is, volumes can decrease, but only up to a point. The expected volume
decrease must be smaller than that determined by the volume hurdle for a price increase to 
improve profi ts. Price increases that can be expected to lead to volume reductions less than 
the volume hurdle are predicted to improve profi tability. Those that don’t are anticipated 
to damage profi tability.
The volume hurdle depends on the size of the price change under consideration. Larger 
price changes require greater volume hurdles to be met, and smaller price changes are
associated with smaller volume hurdles. 
The volume hurdle also depends on the size of the contribution margin and therefore
indirectly depends upon variable costs. In this case, larger contribution margins yield smaller 
volume hurdles. Smaller contribution margins yield larger volume hurdles. 
Notice that fi xed costs play no role in identifying the volume hurdle. It may surprise 
many executives, but fi xed costs are irrelevant for marginal price change decisions. While 
fi rms must cover fi xed costs to stay in business, fi xed costs do not affect the optimal price. 
As an issue, fi xed costs affect the investment decision to enter, stay in, or exit a business, 
but they should have no impact on pricing. If a fi rm determines that the optimal price is insuf-
fi cient to cover fi xed costs, executives may want to divest from that industry, identify means 
to reduce fi xed costs, or take actions to improve its customers’ willingness to pay. But, raising 
prices to cover fi xed costs is simply not justifi ed from a profi t maximization viewpoint.
Put crudely, the fi rm’s fi xed costs are that fi rm’s problem, not the customers’. Customers
are not responsible for the fi rm’s cost structure, but they are responsible for ensuring that 
the value they get from a product is greater than the price they pay. Prices defi ne the way 
that value is shared between the fi rm and its customers. The profi t sensitivity analysis

Profit’s Sensitivity to Price
focuses on the effect of price changes to both customer behavior and a fi rm’s profi ts. 
Through it, we see fi xed costs are irrelevant when optimizing price to improve profi ts. 
The volume hurdle is a necessary condition for pricing actions to improve the
profi tability of the fi rm, but it is not a suffi cient condition. Every time a price change is 
contemplated, volume hurdles should be the fi rst line of analysis. No pricing action should 
be taken if the volume hurdle is unlikely to be achieved. However, there are times when 
executives may forgo a pricing action even though they expect the volume hurdle to be 
overcome. That is, even though executives may expect a pricing action to deliver volumes 
greater than those required by the volume hurdle, it may be in their best interest to avoid 
the price change due to other strategic factors. Volume hurdles provide an important fi rst 
check on the pricing decisions, but not the fi nal word.
Many strategic factors will guide executives to apply more requirements than the 
 volume hurdle in considering a pricing action. Volume hurdles do not take into account 
long-term changes in customer demand that may be infl uenced by a pricing action. For 
instance, a price reduction may stimulate demand in the short term, which relaxes to its 
previous level only once the novelty has worn off. Likewise, volume hurdles ignore  several 
signifi cant tertiary effects of a price change, which would encourage executives to be more 
cautious of price changes than that determined by the volume hurdle alone. One of these 
tertiary effects is that a temporary price reduction can reset customer  expectations, mak-
ing it diffi cult to restore prices following a promotional period. Another tertiary  effect can 
come from competitors who react to a price reduction with a matching offer, thus reduc-
ing the ability of a price promotion to draw volumes and lowering the overall industry 
price level. These and other more subtle effects will be  considered in later chapters of this 
book, but they are mentioned here as a point of caution: Volume hurdles are only the fi rst 
line of analysis for price changes and do not necessarily provide suffi cient justifi cation for 
taking a pricing action.
For tactical decisions, the volume hurdle can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of 
short-term price promotions and discounts. For strategic decisions, the volume hurdle can 
be used to consider both price reductions and increases. Price reductions may be neces-
sary for entering a larger market at a lower price point. If the fi rm has suffi cient assurance 
that the necessary volume will exist at a lower price point, it may benefi t from pursuing 
this market. Price increases may be associated with entering a new market or distribution 
channel. They may also be possible when variable costs have been creeping up industry-
wide and competitors feel a common pressure to improve prices. If the fi rm believes that 
customers will accept a price increase without an excessively negative volume impact, then 
the fi rm should expect to benefi t from a price increase.
Price Cuts Hurt
The minimum required impact on unit sales of a price reduction for different types
of business can be determined easily with the volume hurdle. We take up the case of 
a hypothetical retailer, manufacturer, and broker to demonstrate that price cuts are 
hard to justify. 
Consider a retailer that marks up its products 100 percent. This retailer would be 
earning a 50 percent contribution margin with each sale (CMi 5 50 percent). A com-
mon 20-percent-off sales promotion might be used to drive store traffi c and move 
merchandise (%DP 5 220 percent). In this case, the temporary 20-percent-off sale 
would need to deliver more than 67 percent greater volume if the sale is to improve 
profi tability (%DQ $ 67 percent). That is, two-thirds more sales are required during 
the price promotion to justify a 20-percent-off sale. 
Similarly, consider a manufacturer earning a healthy 25 percent contribution margin on 
each unit sold (CMi 5 25%). A mere 5 percent discount extended to a particular customer

would need to increase sales to that customer by more than 25 percent (%DP 5 25 percent, 
%DQ $ 25 percent). That is, one-quarter more sales are required from the customer to 
justify a 5 percent discount.
Finally, consider a broker earning a slim 1.5 percent contribution margin (CMi 5 1.5 per-
cent). In this case, a 10-basis-point price decrease would need to deliver more than 7.1 percent
greater volume to justify the “break” in the broker’s commission (%DP 5 20.10 percent, 
%DQ $ 7.1 percent). 
These volume increases are hard to achieve with a mere price decrease. Furthermore, the 
volume hurdle is only a necessary condition for executing a price cut. There may be other 
factors to consider prior to executing a price reduction. Because price cuts are hard to justify, 
executives are usually better served if they search for other means to increase sales.
Price Increases Are Challenging
The allowable impact on unit sales resulting from a price increase can also be deter-
mined from the volume hurdle. Once again, we consider a hypothetical retailer, manufac-
turer, and broker. A retailer earning a 50 percent contribution margin and considering a
20 percent price increase can lose up to 29 percent of its business and still increase profi ts
(CMi 5 50 percent, %DP 5 120 percent, %DQ $ 229 percent). A manufacturer earning 
a 25 percent contribution margin and considering a 5 percent price increase can allow 
for a 17 percent loss in unit sales and still profi t from a price increase (CMi 5 25 percent, 
%DP 5 15 percent, %DQ $ 217 percent). Finally, a broker with a 1.5 percent con-
tribution margin executing a 10-basis-point commission increase must lose no more than
6.3 percent of its sales. (CMi 5 1.5 percent, %DP 5 10.10 percent, %DQ $ 26.3 percent).
There are times in which price increases will have negligible effects on unit sales. In 
most markets, however, customers will take fi erce advantage of any disparity in prices be-
tween competing fi rms. Thus, price increases are likely to drive many sales away and will 
be challenging to put into effect. 
Price Changes Have Asymmetric Effects
A careful examination of this analysis reveals that the effects of a price change are asym-
metric. For instance, the manufacturer considering a 5 percent price decrease or increase 
is either requiring unit sales to increase by at least 25 percent, or allowing unit sales to 
drop by no more than 17 percent, respectively. We can see the asymmetrical effects of price 
changes with a simple plot. 
Exhibit 2-2 plots the volume hurdle as a function of price changes for our hypothetical 
manufacturer. We have used the economists’ convention of plotting price on the vertical 
access and volume on the horizontal access. If the price change is associated with a volume 
change that is to the right of the curve depicting the volume hurdle, it will improve profi ts. 
If the price change is associated with a volume change that is to the left of the curve depict-
ing the volume hurdle, it will harm profi ts. 
The asymmetry of the volume hurdle as a function of price is also demonstrated by its 
curve. The volume hurdle rises more quickly when the price change is negative than it falls 
when the price change is positive. These results are common. For all fi rms, the volume hurdles 
associated with price increases are much smaller than those associated with price reductions.
Elasticity of Demand
While the profi t sensitivity analysis reveals the volume hurdle that a pricing action must 
meet, it does not indicate what the volume will be. Management intuition informed 
through past experience may leave executives to suspect that the volume hurdle will be 
surpassed, but measured fact is a more reliable predictor.

Chapter 2 
Profit’s Sensitivity to Price
Elasticity of demand is a measure of the changes in volume delivered with a change in 
price. Formally, it is defi ned as the ratio of the percent change in volume to the percent 
change in price:
« ;  %DQ 
______ 
%DP  
Eq. 2.10
We have used « (pronounced “epsilon”) to denote the elasticity of demand in accor-
dance with economic conventions. Numerically, the elasticity of demand is negative for 
normal markets, implying fewer goods are sold at higher prices and more goods are sold at 
lower prices. By convention, economists tend to drop the sign in speaking about the elas-
ticity of demand. Thus a large elasticity of demand is large in absolute value but negative 
in direction, and a small elasticity of demand is small in absolute value but also negative 
in direction.
Executives can use a measured elasticity of demand to predict the expected volume 
change resulting from a price change. For small price changes, the elasticity of demand can 
be approximated as a constant. Thus, the simple product of the percent change in price 
multiplied by the elasticity of demand will predict the change in volume that an executive 
should expect to result from a price change.
%DQ 5 « ? %DP 
Eq. 2.11
Coupled with the volume hurdle, this simple metric is a highly powerful tool for in-
forming pricing decisions. By comparing the volume hurdle identifi ed in Equation 2.11 
against the change in volume predicted from the elasticity of demand in Equation 2.11, 
executives can easily discriminate between price changes that improve profi ts and those 
which don’t.

ELASTIC MARKETS
Markets are said to be elastic when a small change in price has a large effect on the 
quantity sold. Quantitatively, elastic markets are defi ned as markets with an elasticity 
of demand that is greater than 1 (|«| . 1). Most fi rms face elastic demand curves, which 
means that a small change in price drives a large change in demand. This is a direct result 
of competition. In competitive markets, customers switch suppliers when price changes 
alter the disparity in offers between competitors. 
In the short run, elastic markets tend to favor price cuts to improve profi tability. A 
high elasticity of demand implies that a small price cut delivers a large enough volume 
 increase to overcome the volume hurdle. We can see this by overlaying the change in 
 volume  predicted from the elasticity of demand (shown by the gray curve in Exhibit 2-3) 
with the volume hurdle (the black curve). From Exhibit 2-3, we see that the predicted 
change in volume is greater than the volume hurdle for a wide range of potential price 
cuts. However, for any price increase, the predicted change in volume is greater than the 
allowable volume hurdle. Thus, elastic markets favor price reductions.
INELASTIC MARKETS
Markets are said to be inelastic when a large change in price has only a small effect on the 
quantity sold. Quantitatively, inelastic markets are defi ned as markets with an elasticity of 
demand that is less than 1 (|«| , 1). Many industries face inelastic demand curves. Mean-
ing, at the industry level, demand changes little when prices across the market change 
greatly. However, as implied previously, only a few fi rms face inelastic demand curves.
Inelastic markets tend to favor price increases to improve profi tability. A small elasticity 
of demand implies a large price increase can be expected to yield negligibly small reduc-
tions in volume, and thus it will leave demand above the allowable volume hurdle.

Overlaying the change in volume predicted from the elasticity of demand with the volume 
hurdle in Exhibit 2-4, we can compare predictions and requirements once again. In this case, 
we see that the predicted change in volume is less than the allowable volume hurdle for a 
wide range of potential price increases. However, for any price cut, the predicted change in 
volume is less than the volume hurdle. Thus, inelastic markets favor price increases.
MEASURED ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
In many mature markets, the elasticity of demand can be routinely measured and used to 
inform pricing decisions. In general, historic metrics of the elasticity of demand are bet-
ter quantifi ed for more commodity-oriented products than they are for branded goods. 
As products become less commodity-oriented and suppliers offer greater differentiation 
between competing products, there tends to be greater uncertainty in the measurements 
of elasticity of demand.
Quantifying the elasticity of demand involves careful statistical analysis. Rarely is it 
as simple as running a simple linear regression of volume changes against price changes. 
Many factors will infl uence demand outside of prices. Market environmental factors 
such as seasonal effects, market growth, income changes, and business cycles are all 
major infl uences on demand. Likewise, industry practices that determine competitive
intensity, distribution intensity, promotional intensity, and product evolutions will
also infl uence demand. Disentangling the impact of market environmental factors and 
industry practices from the relationship of prices and volumes requires carefully collect-
ing the relevant data from numerous sources, painstakingly combining it into a single 
dataset with enough data points to provide meaningful insights, and repeatedly running 
a multivariate regression analysis under different assumptions until the market has been 
understood accurately.
The short-term elasticity of demand for several markets can be found in Exhibit 2-5. 
The values reported for brand choice refl ects the fi rm-level elasticity of demand. Those for 
primary demand refl ect the category-level elasticity of demand.

Notice that in all cases, the fi rm-level elasticity of demand is greater than or equal to 
that at the category level. This is refl ective of customer behavior. When the price of an 
individual brand increases, customers readily switch brands to a lower-cost alternative. 
However, when the prices on all brands in the category increase, customers have to reduce 
their purchases to save money. Category-level switching is far more diffi cult than brand-
level switching; hence, the elasticity of demand at the category level will be less than that 
at the brand level. 
The short-term elasticity of demand is often lower than the long-term elasticity of de-
mand. In the short term, customers are often locked into a particular purchasing pattern. 
In the long term, however, customers may uncover substitutes or change their lifestyle 
to reduce their need for the product. For example, the price of gas in the United States 
jumped from $1.27 to $4.11 between 2000 and 2008, but the demand changed very little. 
The measured elasticity of demand was less than 20.04. Consumers grumbled about the 
higher prices, but their consumption patterns could not change instantly because they still 
required fuel to commute to work, go shopping, and meet other transportation needs. In 
those intervening years, however, some consumers bought bicycles, increased their use 
of mass transit, and switched to more fuel-effi cient cars in response to the price change. 
Thus, the long-run elasticity of demand has been estimated to be slightly higher, perhaps 
around 20.06.
NECESSARY, BUT INSUFFICIENT
In reviewing the reported elasticities of demand, we also notice that demand at the fi rm 
level is often elastic, while that at the category level remains inelastic. Executives should 
take notice of this observation. This result derives directly from the nature of competition. 
In a perfectly competitive market, individual fi rms face infi nitely elastic demand regard-
less of the elasticity of demand for the industry as a whole. For pricing decisions, this has 
a very strong implication. Managers should be very cautious of pricing actions that may 
reduce the overall industry-level prices. 
The fact that the brand-level elasticity of demand is lower than the category-level 
elasticity of demand reveals a key reason why volume hurdles are a necessary condition

Profit’s Sensitivity to Price
for evaluating a price change but not a suffi cient condition for judging a pricing action 
as healthy.
For instance, consider the potential sequence of events that could arise from a price 
cut guided solely from a volume hurdle and volume prediction made from the elasticity 
of demand. Executives may predict that the price cut will increase profi ts and therefore 
believe that it is in their best interest. However, by failing to consider competitive reac-
tions, the decision may be misguided. If the increase in volume associated with a price cut 
comes at a competitor’s expense, the fi rm should expect that competitor to react. If the 
competitor’s response is to match the fi rm’s price cut, all temporary gains in volume will 
be lost and both the fi rm and its competitor will be pricing their product at a new, lower 
price point. The result would be to lower the overall industry-level prices, thus harming 
industry profi ts.
Most fi rms would earn greater profi ts by being a middling fi rm within a healthy industry 
than a leading fi rm within a hemorrhaging industry. Hence, many fi rms will be better served 
by seeking to raise or at least maintain their prices to promote overall industry health, rather 
than lowering them to take a greater share but damage the industry as a whole. 
We see evidence that these kinds of event sequences are not only possible, but probable 
in the measures of elasticity of demand. As noted before, elastic markets favor price cuts 
and, as observed, most brands face elastic markets. Therefore, executives at individual 
fi rms face a strong incentive to lower their prices. However, we also should examine the 
value of price change at the industry level. As noted before, inelastic markets favor price 
increases and, as observed, many industries face inelastic markets. Therefore, executives 
within most industries would be, in aggregate, better off if the industry-level prices in-
creased. These insights can be explained easily by the actions of individual fi rms that have 
reduced prices to take market share, only to fi nd that they have been matched by their 
competitors and left the industry impoverished overall.
The competitive reaction to price cuts and the potential for destroying profi ts industry-
wide is one of the more convincing reasons that volume predictions from the elasticity of 
demand and volume hurdles are insuffi cient guidelines for pricing decisions. Both of these 
quantitative approaches ignore competitive reactions. They also fail to consider the dif-
ferences between long-term changes in consumer behavior and short-term predictability. 
Executives should require expectations for the volume hurdle to be surpassed as a fi rst-
line evaluation of a potential price cut, but they cannot stop their analysis there. Further 
considerations must be included in their analysis. Often the next steps in the analysis will 
be less concretely quantitative in nature and more qualitative, but pricing is not a simple 
engineering challenge—it is a strategic challenge.
Economic Price Optimization
From the profi t sensitivity analysis, we see that raising prices can increase profi ts directly 
by improving contribution margins and decrease profi ts indirectly through their moder-
ating effect on demand. These insights imply that there is some price that balances the 
opposing infl uences and delivers the maximum profi ts. Economic price optimization is 
an approach to identify the profi t maximizing price. Any price above the optimum will 
damage profi ts by depressing demand suffi ciently to destroy gains created by improving 
margins. Any price below the optimum will damage profi ts by decreasing margins more 
than the gains earned in improving volumes.
We have been able to quantify the required volume hurdles for a price change to 
improve profi ts from the fi rm’s profi t equation. We have also been able to quantify the 
expected volume change associated with a price change from the elasticity of demand. 
Economic price optimization builds on these approaches to identify further the optimal 
price that delivers maximal profi ts.

Demand decreases along with price increases for any normal good. If we plot the de-
mand at a given price given an understanding of the overall demand and the elasticity of 
demand, we will fi nd a downward-sloping curve much like that in Exhibit 2-6. Because 
price predicts volume through the elasticity of demand, we can also identify the profi ts 
earned from the product at any volume. As seen in Exhibit 2-6, profi ts exhibit a typical 
inverted parabola-like curve when plotted against volume. At the peak of this parabola-
like curve, profi ts will be maximized.
Exhibit 2-6 depicts the prices and profi ts associated with a specifi c volume sold for a 
hypothetical fi rm. We have modeled the fi rm to have fi xed costs of $1 million per quarter 
and variable costs of $10 per unit. To model demand, we used a constant elasticity of de-
mand equal to 21.67 (a value representative of many fi rms in many industries) and set the 
overall demand equal to 368,000 units per quarter if the product was priced at marginal 
costs. (In general, demand models require identifying the demand at a particular price 
and the elasticity of demand around that price.) Given these fi gures, the price is optimized 
for this product at $25. At this optimal price, the fi rm would sell 80,000 units and earn 
$200,000 per quarter. See also Exhibit 1-1.
To derive the optimal price from the elasticity of demand and the known demand at a 
particular price requires a little calculus. Interested readers can follow the derivation in 
Appendix 2.B. Assuming that the elasticity of demand is constant over the range of prices 
under consideration, we can express the relationship between prices and volumes as

produces a false sense of accuracy. Despite the inherent attractiveness of getting an exact 
price based on historic metrics of elasticity of demand, marginal costs, and other inde-
pendently verifi able quantities, prices should rarely be set in this manner. Its quantitative 
beauty provides not only an overly precise picture of the supposed right price, but the 
price may be completely wrong as well.
Economic price optimization suffers from a challenge in identifying the relevant elastic-
ity of demand and variable costs to use in calculating the price. Neither of these challenges 
can be overcome appropriately using historic metrics, and both lead to wildly inaccurate 
price predictions when used in economic price optimization.
The primary challenge of economic price optimization is in identifying the relevant 
elasticity of demand. Even if economists have precisely quantifi ed the elasticity of de-
mand at both the fi rm level and the industry level, executives may be uncertain how 
to proceed. As noted earlier, most fi rms sell products that individually face an elastic 
demand. Price optimization using the elasticity of demand alone would encourage most 
fi rms to lower their prices. Doing so would no doubt leave the fi rm’s prices below the in-
dustry norm, thus encouraging its competitors to follow suit with similar price decreases 
to recover the lost sales volume. The result would be an impoverished fi rm overall. In 
contrast, many industries face an inelastic demand, and economic price optimization at 
the industry level would encourage many fi rms to raise their prices in aggregate. If one 
fi rm raises its prices in accordance with the overall industry-level elasticity of demand, 
but other fi rms did not, customers would switch brands quickly, and again the fi rm 
would be impoverished overall. Hence, neither of these elasticities of demand is useful 
in fi nding the optimal price.
The secondary challenge of economic price optimization is in uncovering the relevant 
marginal costs. The relevant marginal costs depend on the time frame under consideration. 
In the narrowest sense, short-run marginal costs may include little more than raw materi-
als as the production capacity must be maintained from one second to the next. In the 
medium run, marginal costs would expand to include other factors such as labor, facilities, 
and equipment. In the long run, the decision to invest or divest from production capacity 
and marketing activities depends on the expected units to be sold, and therefore it can 
infl uence the meaning of marginal costs.
Because of the challenges inherent in price optimization through purely economic argu-
ments, executives are wise not to use this approach. Only in rarifi ed and idealized cases 
can prices be optimized solely through historic metrics of the elasticity of demand and the 
cost accountant’s interpretation of variable costs. For almost every fi rm, this is a highly 
dubious approach. 
Accepting these challenges, executives may use economic price optimization to create 
a range of potential prices. From the industry-level price elasticity, they may be able to 
identify a higher price that would improve the fi rm’s and industry’s profi ts overall. From 
the fi rm-level price elasticity, they may identify the minimum price to charge if all other 
competitive actions were thwarted and customers behaved in a consistent manner.
Proﬁ t Sensitivity Analysis with Changing Cost Structures
The analysis considered so far is that of a pure price change in the absence of any cost 
changes. In many cases, executives face the issue of making a price change in response to a 
change in the product. Quality-oriented manufacturers often make product improvements 
with the expectation that a higher price can be earned with a higher-value good. Likewise, 
cost-oriented manufacturers may seek to reduce costs in the belief that a larger market 
may exist at a lower price point. In either case, cost changes are often associated with price 
changes. In a similar manner as that used in the case of a pure price change, we can also 
examine the profi t sensitivity to concurrent changes in costs and price.

We can defi ne volume hurdles for a product under the relaxed constraint of allowing 
for both a price and variable costs. Using the same generalized profi t equation, but this

Eq. 2.15b
The volume hurdle under changing variable costs, Equation 2.14, is highly dependent on 
the effect of changes in the contribution margin. We can see this in Exhibit 2-7. In Exhibit 
2-7, we have returned to our hypothetical fi rm with a $15 initial contribution margin.
A negative change in contribution margin may arise from increasing the variable costs 
less than a commensurate increase in price, or decreasing variable costs less than a com-
mensurate decrease in price. If the change in the contribution margin is negative, the 
volume hurdle will be positive. In this case, the volume hurdle will indicate the required 
increase in sales to justify the product improvement without a price increase.
Negative changes in contribution margins can be anticipated to harm profi ts in general. 
For instance, consider a product enhancement that costs more to deliver than the price 
can be increased. In this case, the contribution margins will be squeezed even though the 
prices are higher. In general, a fi rm should expect to sell fewer, not more, units at a higher 
price point unless competitive pressures or other factors have worked to redefi ne the price 
to quality tradeoffs for customers. Thus, in most cases, a price increase smaller than the 
variable cost increase would decrease both contribution margins and volumes, collectively 
harming profi ts.
A positive change in the contribution margin may arise from an increase in price greater 
than the commensurate increases in variable costs, or decreasing variable costs more than

decreasing price. If the change in contribution margin is positive, the volume hurdle will 
be negative. In this case, the volume hurdle will indicate the allowable drop in sales, which 
would improve profi ts when the price and marginal costs increase.
Positive changes in contribution margins can be anticipated to improve profi ts in general. 
For instance, consider a product refi nement that both strips out costs and is targeted to sell at a 
lower price point but with an overall increase in contribution margins. In this case, the contri-
bution margins may be higher even though prices are lower. In general, a fi rm should expect to 
sell more units at a lower price point. Thus, in most cases, this strategic action would improve 
both contribution margins and volumes, and thus collectively improve profi ts. 
Just as we have conducted a profi t sensitivity analysis for the case of changing vari-
able costs, we can also conduct one for the case of changing fi xed costs. Firms may face 
changes in their fi xed costs when expanding to a new market, improving production, 
altering distribution, or making other operational changes in response to a strategic 
 opportunity. In this case, we fi nd

where Ff is the fi nal fi xed costs and Fi the initial fi xed costs, and DF equals Ff 2 Fi.

Summary
• Anticipating the customer’s response to price changes empowers executives to 
analyze the profi t sensitivity to price changes and improve prices.
• In a profi t sensitivity analysis, volume hurdles are identifi ed. For a pure price 
reduction, the volume hurdle will be positive and will identify the minimum 
required volume increase needed for a price cut to improve profi ts. For a pure price 
increase, the volume hurdle will be negative and will identify the allowable volume 
decrease for the price hike to improve profi ts. 
• Profi ts are asymmetrically sensitive to price changes. A price decrease is associated 
with a larger volume hurdle than an equivalently sized price increase is with an 
allowable volume decrease. 
• Prior to executing a price reduction in the form of a discount, coupon, or other form 
of sales promotion, executives should conduct a profi t sensitivity analysis to uncover 
a necessary condition for the pricing action to improve profi tability. Even if the 
volume hurdle can be anticipated to be surpassed, fi rms may be wise to refrain from 
a price reduction because of potential competitive responses or changes in consumer 
behavior that will destroy any anticipated gains from a price reduction.
• A profi t sensitivity analysis can also be conducted in the case of a cost change 
that is associated with a price change. As with pure price changes, volume hurdles 
are identifi ed that must be cleared for the simultaneous price and cost change to 
increase profi ts.
• The elasticity of demand is a measure of the consumer response to price changes. 
• Elastic markets have an elasticity of demand greater than 1. In elastic markets, 
small changes in price are correlated with large changes in quantity sold. Elastic 
markets usually favor price cuts.
• Inelastic markets have an elasticity of demand less than 1. In inelastic markets, 
large changes in price are correlated with small changes in quantity sold. Inelastic 
markets usually favor price increases.

• Brand-level elasticity of demand typically is higher than industry-level elasticity of 
demand. 
• Price optimization through a basic economic model depends only on the elasticity 
of demand and variable cost to produce.
• A reduction of prices below the optimal price leads to insuffi cient gains from 
volume increases to cover the greater losses from the contribution margin 
decrease. An increase in prices above the optimal price leads to insuffi cient gains 
in contribution margins to cover the greater losses from decreased volumes. The 
optimal price balances these gains and losses to deliver the highest potential profi t. 
• Despite their beauty, economic price optimization usually identifi es the wrong 
price. The primary challenge to economic price comes from identifying the relevant 
elasticity of demand for pricing decisions. The secondary challenge comes from 
identifying the relevant variable costs. Economic price optimization may be useful 
for some pricing questions, but it is a highly dubious approach to pricing in general.

A Discrete Demand
While economic texts usually assume that demand is a continuous function of price, in 
many cases, it isn’t. In many industries, demand is nonlinearly dependent upon price. At 
certain price points, a product may have a large change in demand as customers fi nd a new 
use for the product and the product displaces a substitute. 
For instance, consider the aluminum industry.4 In the 1930s, aluminum had fi ve major 
applications: aircraft sheet bodies, metallurgy, cooking utensils, electric cables, automotive 
parts. Each use for aluminum had a different value to its customers and would displace a 
different substitute material. 
The most valuable use of aluminum in the 1930s was in the manufacturing of air-
craft. Although the aircraft sheet body market represented only 10 percent of the out-
put of Alcoa in 1930, it was highly valuable. Few realistic alternatives to lightweight 
and structurally sturdy aluminum could be used in the development of commercial 
and military aircraft. Moreover, the demand for aircraft sheet body aluminum was 
derived from the overall demand from the air transport industry, and hence it was 
highly inelastic.
Metallurgical application of aluminum was in the development of sheet metal. In 
1930, 8 to 10 percent of Alcoa sales were for metallurgical purposes. Prices for alumi-
num in the metallurgical market could be somewhat high, though not as high as they 
could be in the aircraft industry. Moreover, demand in the metallurgical market was 
largely inelastic because aluminum represented a small portion of the cost of produc-
ing sheet metal and the demand depended upon the overall demand within the larger 
steel industry. 
The other markets for aluminum were signifi cantly more elastic. Aluminum sold for 
cooking utensils represented about 40 percent of the volume in 1940. Although superior 
over other material in lightness, resistance to chipping, and ease of cleaning, customers 
could easily substitute enamel cookware for most aluminum cookware. Aluminum sold 
for electric cables represented 10 to 15 percent of volume by 1940. Aluminum cables were 
inferior to copper cables in conductivity but superior in lightness, and hence they were 
found to be of value only in specifi c applications. Aluminum sold for electrical purposes 
typically was discounted to stimulate sales. Automotive sales of aluminum represented
17 percent of Alcoa’s sales in 1930 and were related to the use of aluminum in machine 
parts. The automotive market was also highly elastic because manufacturers could use 
steel in many applications instead of aluminum.
If aluminum were sold to all markets at one price and the price were set in pro-
portion to the willingness to pay of the aircraft sheet body market, only aircraft

manufacturers would purchase it, and there would be little or no demand from the 
metallurgical market or other areas. Not until the price of aluminum became competi-
tive to its substitutes for the metallurgical market would that market purchase. At that 
point, the overall demand would increase sharply. Thus, the cumulative demand curve 
for aluminum, if priced at one price to all markets, would have numerous infl ection 
points corresponding to the prices at which aluminum became competitive for specifi c 
industries. See Exhibit 2-8 for a qualitative understanding of the price-to-demand 
relationship.
To segregate these markets and price in proportion to each market’s willingness to pay, 
Alcoa forward-integrated into specifi c industries and sold aluminum ingots of varying 
quality. This enabled Alcoa to improve its ability to price aluminum differently depend-
ing on its application. Alcoa’s pricing practice was altered only after 1937, when the U.S. 
Department of Justice fi led a Sherman Act civil suit.5 
When a product has multiple applications where each application has a different value 
to its customers and the product is sold to all customers at the same price, the demand can 
be better thought of as coming in discrete chunks rather than as a continuous function of 
price. That is, the cumulative demand at any one price is the sum of the demand of all mar-
kets up to that price. Once the price of the product makes it competitive to a substitute, a 
new market application becomes economically viable, and demand will increase sharply.
Executives considering repricing a product to serve a new market application should 
consider the willingness to pay of that market and its potential demand volume. As with 
continuously varying demand curves, a profi t sensitivity analysis will reveal the required 
volume to justify a price resetting designed to attack a new market application.
Attempts at pricing the same product at two different levels for two different mar-
ket applications may fall foul of legal restrictions, as Alcoa discovered. Even in cases 
where legal restrictions don’t apply, enterprising individuals will commonly develop 
means of buying products designed and sold to one market and resell them to the 
second, higher-value market, pocketing the price differential as their own profi t. The 
result is what is commonly called a gray market. Many industries have learned how 
to work with gray markets and manage them, but gray markets are generally a source

of consternation. One method of minimizing both the legal and gray-market risk is to 
reengineer the product such that it becomes suffi ciently differentiated for each market 
application. In these situations, executives can optimize the price independently for 
each individual market.
Derivation of Economic Price Optimization
In Equation 2.13, we provided the economically optimal price given the variable costs and 
elasticity of demand. The derivation of Equation 2.13 is a direct result of the defi nition of 
the elasticity of demand and the fi rm’s profi t equation.6
The optimal price is that which maximizes profi ts. At the maximal profi t, the slope of 
the profi t curve with respect to deviations in price is zero. Using calculus, we can fi nd this 
price by setting the fi rst derivative of the profi t equation to zero. From Equation 2.1 for 
the fi rm’s profi t, we fi nd the fi rst derivative of profi t with respect to price to be

where we have assumed that demand (Q) depends on price while variable costs (V) and 
fi xed costs (F) are constants with respect to price changes.
The optimal price can be found at the point where the fi rst derivative of profi ts with 
respect to price is equal to zero. Thus, setting the fi rst derivative of profi ts in Equation 2.17 
equal to zero, we fi nd the optimal price to be constrained by the condition

Notes
1 Economists use the term Giffen good to describe a good that violates the law of demand…. Giffen goods are 
inferior goods for which the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Therefore, they have demand 
curves that slope upward. Have any actual Giffen goods ever been observed? Some historians suggest 
that potatoes were a Giffen good during the Irish potato famine of the 19th century. Potatoes were such 
a large part of people’s diet that when the price of potatoes rose, it had a large income effect. People 
responded to their reduced living standard by cutting back on the luxury of meat and buying more of the 
staple food of potatoes. Thus, it is argued that a higher price of potatoes actually raised the quantity of 
potatoes demanded. N. Gregory Mankiw, “The Theory of Consumer Choice,” Principles of Economics,

iven the tools defi ned up to this point, executives might be greatly dismayed at the 
inability of the basic quantitative means of identifying a good price. On one hand, 
exchange value models provide pricing guidance that is accurate but perhaps too 
wide. On the other hand, economic price optimization provides pricing guidance that is 
highly precise but often misleading. To set prices, executives require an approach that is 
both accurate and precise. Using customer perceptions directly is a proven means of guiding 
pricing decisions with both acceptable accuracy and precision.
Customer perception–driven pricing has become the dominant approach to pricing in 
many industries. Through market research, the willingness of customers to pay is iden-
tifi ed, either directly or indirectly. The most common methodology for using customer 
perceptions to set prices is conjoint analysis.1 Conjoint analysis is marketed under many

different trade names and will vary in form; however, all these forms and trade names 
share a common foundation. Conjoint analysis reveals the tradeoffs that customers make 
in purchasing decisions and therefore identifi es the best price that can both encourage cus-
tomer purchases and deliver profi ts. Furthermore, conjoint analysis can be used to expand 
a pricing challenge beyond pricing a specifi c product to the more complex challenge of 
uncovering the willingness to pay for alternative variations of that product.
Conjoint analysis rose to dominate pricing challenges for evolutionary markets due 
to its precision and accuracy. As already discussed, exchange value models can identify 
a range of good prices. This range can be rather wide, however, driving executives to seek 
further clarity. Through conjoint analysis, executives can be much more precise in identi-
fying the specifi c price most likely to optimize profi ts. On the other hand, economic price 
optimization allows executives to identify the predicted best price with extreme precision, 
but with little assurance that this price is indeed accurate, due to the inherent challenge of 
identifying the relevant metric of the elasticity of demand. Conjoint analysis overcomes 
this challenge and accurately identifi es the best price for an individual product in the face 
of competition in many situations. 
In this chapter, we provide an executive-level description of conjoint analysis and
complete our exploration of rational approaches to setting prices. While the fi ner points 
of conjoint analysis can be found in texts dedicated to market research and statistical 
analysis, we will focus on an executive-level description of the approach. Every executive 
charged with pricing decisions should understand conjoint analysis at a managerial level 
to evaluate the merits of this approach for specifi c pricing decisions. 
Despite the superior attributes of conjoint analysis, it is not the best approach for all 
pricing challenges. Exchange value models, conjoint analysis, and economic price opti-
mization each has its place in guiding pricing decisions. Hence, we will also provide an 
analysis of the managerial tradeoffs in selecting one of the three dominant approaches to 
price setting. 
Matching the Price-Setting Approach to the Market Stage
Exchange value calculators, economic price optimization, and conjoint analysis are the 
three dominant approaches to setting prices. Using any of these three approaches, execu-
tives can address an overwhelming majority of their price-setting challenges. Each of these 
approaches has been used in both business and consumer markets, services and tangible 
goods markets, and durable and consumable goods markets. Each also has its benefi ts 
and drawbacks in terms of accuracy and precision. Fortunately, there are clear differences 
in the appropriateness of these approaches in addressing the specifi c pricing challenge.2 
Executives may be able to select which approach should be used for their specifi c pricing 
challenge based on a few simple tradeoffs. 
One of the key issues to align in selecting a price-setting approach is the market matu-
rity. In revolutionary markets, where the product is defi ning a new product category and 
there are no directly competing offers, exchange value models tend to dominate the price-
setting challenge. At the other extreme, in highly mature markets of commodity products 
where the difference between competing products is negligible, economic price optimiza-
tion will dominate in price-setting questions. Between these two extremes, for established 
markets where products are evolving in both adding new points of value and fi nding new 
means of reducing costs, conjoint analysis is the dominate approach to setting prices.
REVOLUTIONARY MARKETS
In revolutionary markets, both executives and their customers lack suffi cient critical in-
formation required to use most methods of price setting. Revolutionary markets are rare

and unique. They are created by the introduction of the fi rst product into a new market, 
such as the fi rst electric-powered car, the fi rst personal computer, the fi rst railroad line, or 
the fi rst mobile phone network. Truly revolutionary products are breakthrough initiatives 
that redefi ne the status quo, delivering dramatically different or totally new benefi ts to 
customers in a manner that had never before been considered. Compared to the alternative 
approaches, exchange value models are likely to be the best approach to setting prices in 
revolutionary markets. 
The new product creates an entirely new market in a revolution. This revolutionary 
market will have no history from which one could even hope to identify the elasticity of 
demand through econometric means, and hence economic price optimization becomes a 
highly useless approach. 
Furthermore, customers in this revolutionary market will have no experience with 
the product category. Product category experience is necessary for customers to learn 
the features and to inform them of the expected value of differing product  confi gurations. 
If  they lack the benefi t of experience-based learning, customers may be unable to 
 evaluate offers and make reliable tradeoffs. Because conjoint analysis fundamentally 
relies on customers making an informed decision regarding their preferences, it does not 
work well in revolutionary markets. One approach to overcoming this challenge is to 
provide the research subjects with an overwhelming amount of data regarding its value 
to them. At this point, many entrepreneurial fi rms will have been better off simply using 
the price determined by the exchange value model in the fi rst place, and spending their 
limited marketing resources on selling it to customers rather than conducting research 
on them. 
EVOLUTIONARY MARKETS
Evolutionary markets are common. They are markets in which products currently exist, 
customers currently purchase, and products are evolving. Product evolutions are found 
in subtle shifts in the features of products, such as adding chocolate chips to ice cream, 
power transmissions to forklifts, or faster customer service in banking. In comparison to 
the alternative approaches, conjoint analysis is typically the best approach to setting prices 
in evolutionary markets.3
By many measures, evolutionary products represent more than 98 percent of the new 
products on the market. By evolutionary, we mean products that make improvements to 
the status quo rather than disrupt the current evolution of products. The improvements 
in evolutionary markets typically derive from adding new features or benefi ts to existing 
products, whereas new products in revolutionary markets address customer needs in an 
entirely new manner. 
In evolutionary markets, customers have experience with the product category. Through 
their experience, customers will have become aware of the existing products and their 
competition. They may also have developed suffi cient insight to conceptualize different 
combinations of product attributes and predict their benefi ts.  Therefore, in evolutionary 
markets, customers hold suffi cient information that is critically required to make informed 
statements regarding their preferences, and therefore executives can reliably conduct
conjoint analysis. Because evolutionary product enhancements are more common than 
revolutionary product creation, most marketing managers will rely heavily upon conjoint 
analysis.
Conjoint analysis is particularly appropriate and useful for brand managers. In evolu-
tionary markets, not only will customers have familiarity with different features, products, 
and product categories, but they are also highly likely to be familiar with the existing 
brands. Marketing executives of branded goods can use this familiarity to identify price 
points for the product under different competing brand identifi cations, co-branding

arrangements, and new brand introductions. As such, they can select the best brand as-
sociation for a new product in an evolutionary market. 
In comparison to exchange value models, conjoint analysis is more precise in most 
evolutionary markets. External customers tend to have better information than internal 
executives regarding the value the customers themselves will give to a product in contrast 
to its competitors in evolutionary markets. In contrast, internal product managers tend 
to have better information regarding the value of a product relative to its substitutes for 
revolutionary products. As such, conjoint analysis generally provides much deeper and 
more precise insights into the appropriate price in evolutionary markets, while exchange 
value models continue to be the workhorse in revolutionary markets.
A signifi cant exception to this rule is found in small markets. Markets with few custom-
ers (that is, markets where the number of customers is on the order of magnitude of 10 
to 100) are common in many industrial markets. Aircraft, nuclear generation, and paper 
manufacturing machines are good examples of markets with few customers. Because con-
joint analysis relies on market research, and market research is itself reliant on the ability 
to collect data from a statistically relevant set of sample customers, conjoint analysis may 
become untenable in small markets. 
Compared to economic price optimization, conjoint analysis is not only more
accurate but also more relevant in evolutionary markets. Executives managing a prod-
uct are far more interested in the best price for their particular product formulation 
rather than the product category as a whole. The best measures of elasticity of demand, 
a necessary input for economic price optimization, are usually found at the industry 
level. The industry-level elasticity of demand combines all the product features, attri-
butes, and brands into a single metric. This prevents the ability of product managers to 
identify which features add value to the product and which can be dropped to improve 
profi ts. 
MATURE MARKETS
For pure commodities sold to highly mature markets, economic price optimization is often 
used to guide pricing decisions. There is little product differentiation in commodity markets; 
thus, there is little to guide the price differentials required for an exchange value model to 
add value to the decision. Likewise, customers may be unable to differentiate between the 
values of competing commodity products, and therefore conjoint analysis is unlikely to re-
veal signifi cant information. As such, economic price optimization continues to dominate 
pricing discussions for commodity products, and products tend to be sold at the market 
clearing price.
Conjoint Analysis 
In conjoint analysis, researchers measure customer preferences between products.4 Prod-
ucts are treated as a bundle of attributes, features, and benefi ts, where price can be one 
of those features in a conjoint analysis study. By measuring their preferences, research-
ers can detect how customers make tradeoffs and use these tradeoffs to decompose a 
product valuation into the sum of the values that customers assign to specifi c attributes, 
features, and benefi ts. In this manner, executives can determine how customers value 
specifi c product formulations and quantify the source of pricing power within their 
product.
In identifying the value that customers place on specifi c product attributes, features, 
and benefi ts, conjoint analysis creates a part-worth utility function. Because a specifi c 
product is the collection of a set of attributes, features, and benefi ts, the value of

that product to a customer, or its customer net utility, is the sum of their part-worth 
utilities.
By decomposing a product value into its part-worth utilities, executives can ask “what 
if” questions. They can posit alternative variations of product formulations, each with 
its own cost structure, and identify which product formulation could be priced the high-
est, priced the lowest, capture the largest contribution margin, or capture the highest 
sales volume at a given price. Even product formulations that currently don’t exist can 
be valued through conjoint as the sum of a product’s part-worth utilities. The richness 
of these results enables executives to uncover new product compositions and potential 
prices to identify which specifi c product formulation at a specifi c price is likely to deliver 
the highest profi t.
Conjoint analysis is a market research technique, and as such, the quantifi cation of 
value comes directly from the customers’ perspective. This is very important. Recall, in the 
exploration of the range of a good price, one of the key ingredients of capturing a better 
price is knowing how customers value a product. The closer a fi rm can price its products 
to a point just below the value customers place on that product, the higher the price the 
fi rm can capture. While exchange value models enable the fi rm to estimate the value that 
customers will place on a product, conjoint analysis will measure it. 
Customer valuations will vary between customers, and conjoint analysis will reveal 
these variations. The dispersion in valuations can lead to an understanding of the expected 
demand at a given price even before a product is launched. From this anticipated demand 
curve, executives can use some of the techniques explored in economic price optimization 
in identifying the price most likely to deliver the highest profi ts, but with much greater 
accuracy and relevance.
If consumer dispersion in valuations of specifi c features can be aggregated into mean-
ingfully different groups, conjoint analysis can form the basis of highly valuable market 
segmentation. The dispersion in valuations may derive from customers having alternative 
uses for a product that were not originally intended by the producer, or from  satisfying a 
need greater than was anticipated. Market segmentation through product design  requires 
this understanding of how some segments of customers prefer a certain product composi-
tion while other segments prefer an alternative composition. Executives can use these re-
sults to identify which product formulations might be attractive as an entry-level product 
into the category and which might serve as higher-value products to capture the more-
demanding customers.
As with any market research technique, conjoint analysis shows only a snapshot of cus-
tomer desires. New product concepts that may have not been considered in the research design 
may dramatically change the product valuations. Likewise, changes in the economic climate 
can alter the willingness to pay. In a rapidly evolving market, the outcomes from conjoint 
analysis may become dated before the product ever reaches the market. For slowly evolving 
markets, the changes within the market environment are manageable challenges to the out-
comes of a conjoint analysis study.
Conjoint analysis can be done in a variety of forms and the market name for the ap-
proach varies with the form, such as discrete choice, tradeoff analysis, external analysis, or 
conjoint itself. The underlying principles and mathematics are similar across the differing 
forms. In purpose, each form attempts to reveal the structure of customer preferences that 
are ascribed in terms of levels of different attributes.
USING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES TO REVEAL PART-WORTH UTILITIES
In a conjoint analysis study, researchers ask participants that are representative of the
target market to identify their preferences between different products. The products 
that customers choose between are themselves compilations of specifi c sets of features,

attributes, and benefi ts. After customers make selections, the responses are analyzed with 
statistical methods. (Commercially available, off-the-shelf software can be used to auto-
mate the research design and data analysis.) The results from this analysis are the custom-
ers’ part-worth utility functions.
To demonstrate how conjoint analysis can reveal a customer’s part-worth utility func-
tion, we will use a simplifi ed example with mango juice. This example will use hypothetical 
attributes and measurements and is not intended to be representative of fact but rather for 
elucidating the process of conducting a conjoint analysis.5 
Fresh mango juice is common in tropical regions but is harder to fi nd in latitudes 
farther north. As the world’s population becomes more mobile, however, many peoples 
in northern climates are familiar with mango juice, either from their travels abroad or 
from their familiar roots in a tropical climate. Drink makers have increasingly become 
aware of the potential demand for mango juice in northern climates and have recently 
been making products to serve the growing demand. However, mango juice is relatively 
expensive to produce, transport, and distribute to northern climates. In response, many 
producers have chosen to offer mango juice blends rather than pure mango juice. In 
mango juice blends, the beverage is made mostly of non-mango juices such as grape, 
orange, and apple, but will contain some mango or an additive to impart a mango 
fl avor.
For concreteness, consider a hypothetical 32-ounce container of mango juice. The pro-
ducer can either offer pure mango juice or a mango fruit blend, and the product can be 
sold under a well-known national brand or a new premium niche brand. The executives 
would like to know the potential prices of the different formulations of mango juices 
marketed under different brand names. 
In this hypothetical example, there will be three attributes under investigation: ingre-
dients, brand, and price. Each attribute will be investigated at two different levels for this 
simplifi ed example, but more attributes and levels could be explored in a more realistic 
investigation. The two ingredient levels are pure mango juice and mango fruit blend. The 
two branding levels are a well-known national brand and a premium niche brand. The price 
levels under consideration are $4 and $7. See Exhibit 3-1 for a 2 3 4 matrix depiction of 
the eight different potential product attributes and levels. 
In the conjoint analysis study, participants are asked to rank the potential products 
in order of preference. For our example, consider a participant that most prefers pure 
mango juice with a national brand priced at $4 and least prefers mango fruit blend 
priced with a premium niche brand price at $7. Continuing to rank the products, from 
1 being the most preferred to 8 being the least preferred, the participant exhausts 
the potential product formulations. See Exhibit 3-2 for this particular participant’s 
rankings.
The participant’s ranking of potential products is a measure of the utility that he or she 
places on each specifi c product formulation. Those with the highest utility were ranked

fi rst, while those with the lowest utility were ranked last. The researcher can use this to 
prepare the data collected from this participant for evaluation by scoring it from 0 to 7, 
where the lowest score is that which yields the lowest utility and the highest score yields 
the highest utility. See Exhibit 3-3 for the researcher’s data preparation.
These product scores can be used to evaluate the part-worth utility function of this 
participant. The part-worth utility of a specifi c attribute level is found by averaging the 
scores of the products that have that particular attribute level. For simplicity, we will 
measure part-worth utilities with a metric called utils, an economist’s unit of utility. See 
Exhibit 3-4.
To fi nd the participant’s utility for a specifi c product formulation, we simply add the 
part-worth utilities associated with the specifi c attribute levels. We can see that the utility 
valuation from the sum of part-worth utilities reproduces the same rankings as the partici-
pant reported in the survey. See Exhibit 3-5.
Because price was one of the attributes being measured in the conjoint analysis, we 
can place a monetary value on the unit of utils. Specifi cally, the ratio of price disparity in 
the study design to util disparity between the two price points found from the customer 
preferences reveals the dollar value per util. Because the price ranged from $4 to $7 and 
the calculated part-worth utilities ranged from 5.5 to 1.5 utils, we fi nd the valuation of 
$0.75/util. See Equation 3.1.

Chapter 3 
Customer Perception–Driven Pricing
Armed with this information, we can calculate the preference value that this participant 
places on different attribute levels. For instance, Exhibit 3-4 shows that the difference in 
utility of a national brand versus premium niche brand is 1 util, or $0.75. For this partici-
pant, the premium niche brand detracts value from the product with respect to a national 
brand. Likewise, Exhibit 3-4 shows that the difference in utility of pure mango juice versus 
a mango fruit blend is 2 utils, or $1.50. Purity in mango juice adds value for this participant.
We can also use the attribute-level valuations to compare different products that could 
be made. For instance, a new entrant to this market promoting a premium niche brand of 
pure mango juice competing against an established national brand of mango fruit blend 
priced at $4 would have to market its product at a price less than $4.75 to attract this re-
search participant. This product valuation is found by adding the part-worth utility differ-
ences between premium niche versus national (21.0 utils) and that between pure mango 
juice and mango fruit blend (2.0 utils), which yields 1 util. This participant values 1 util at 
$0.75, so this product could attract this participant away from the $4 established brand 
only if priced at or below $4.75.
Different customers will have different rankings leading to different part-worth
utility functions. The aggregate market’s part-worth utility for specifi c attributes is 
the average of each individual participant’s part-worth utility. Rather than fi nding the 
aggregate market’s utility for a product formulation, it is often more insightful to iden-
tify the willingness to pay of each different product formulation for each research 
participant to create potential demand curves for the market of specifi c product for-
mulations. If there are meaningful differences between the utility rankings of market 
research participants that can be aggregated, researchers can also segment the market
and uncover the prices that different segments would be willing to pay for different 
product compositions.

STUDY DESIGN
Conjoint analysis is clearly a very powerful tool to gain insight into customer preferences, 
as the example described previously demonstrates. Its value to executives in understanding 
markets, evaluating products, and identifying prices has made conjoint analysis a routine 
technique of many market researchers to evaluate markets, products, and prices since its 
introduction in 1964. Along the way, the design of a conjoint analysis study has become 
codifi ed.6
In essence, there are fi ve basic steps in a conjoint analysis: (1) defi ning the attributes 
and attribute levels, (2) presenting the stimulus, (3) measuring the response, (4) setting 
the evaluation criterion, and (5) analyzing the data. Each of these will be examined in the 
following sections. 
Deﬁ ning the Attribute 
One of the key values of conjoint analysis is its ability to identify the value that customers 
place on different attributes. To accomplish this task, researchers must clearly defi ne the 
attributes under investigation and the levels of those attributes to be investigated. Con-
joint analysis cannot identify the utility of attributes and levels that are not stated, hence 
the attribute and level lists need to be full, relevant, and executable. 
In our mango juice example, the attributes considered included ingredients, brand, and 
price. To take another example, we could consider a commuter bicycle. A commuter bi-
cycle could be described as a compilation of physical attributes, performance benefi ts, 
and psychological positioning. Physical attributes refer to tangible issues, such as the 
frame weight, or hardware features, such as tire width and braking system. Performance
attributes are the benefi ts that the commuter bicycle will deliver, such as stopping distance 
under wet conditions, or the effect of frame weight and tire width on cycling speed or 
durability in handling potholes in the street. Psychological positioning refers to the feel-
ings that the product could invoke, such as the emotional connection a brand might have 
to Lance Armstrong, or the assurance of stopping quickly in high traffi c, or the desire to 
improve one’s health and look more fi t by commuting to work.
Attribute selection includes both the choice of which attributes will be investigated 
and the different levels of those attributes. For instance, with the commuter bicycle, the 
tires could be evaluated at three levels of width—narrow, medium, or wide—or the se-
lection could be expanded to include fi ve levels by adding extra wide and extra narrow 
widths. Likewise, the braking system could be evaluated as being either of disc or pivot 
type, or it could be expanded to include standard disc, high-performance disc, standard 
pivot, or high-performance pivot, making four different attribute levels for a second 
single attribute. Combined, the difference between using limited levels with these two 
attributes and using an expanded number of levels is one of investigating six (3  2  6) 
different product compositions versus twenty (5 ? 4 5 20). For most pricing questions, 
researchers will have a far lengthier list of attributes, with a wide range of potential levels 
to be investigated.
Presenting the Stimulus 
Products can be presented to research participants in a variety of ways, and the results 
of conjoint analysis may depend in part on the way in which the product in question is 
presented. The development of a survey is an art in itself, and pretesting is commonly 
used to investigate whether the survey questions reveal the facts that are needed to inform 
managerial decision making or fail to interpret the results with certainty. The more popu-
lar forms of stimulus presentation include verbal descriptions, paragraph descriptions, or 
pictorial representations.

Chapter 3 
Customer Perception–Driven Pricing
In a verbal description of the product, the attribute is listed along with its level. Con-
tinuing with the hypothetical mango juice study, the attribute of brand was stated as either 
national brand or premium niche brand. Some of the key advantages to verbal descrip-
tions are its simplicity in execution, effi ciency in collection of data, and variety in number 
of attributes and levels that can be considered in a single study.
Paragraph descriptions are perceived by some researchers to provide a more realistic 
and complete description of the product, which would lead to more reliable measurements 
of results. A signifi cant drawback of paragraph descriptions is that the total number of 
descriptions is limited to a small number, which may lead to an inaccurate understanding 
of the complexity in demand.
With both verbal and paragraph descriptions, care must be taken when preparing the 
stimulus to ensure that executives can interpret the results accurately. For instance, let us 
continue with our commuter bicycle example and the levels of braking system under con-
sideration. The brake levels may be described as either pivot brakes or disc brakes. Pivot 
brakes, which are found on most racing and mountain bicycles, are more common. Disc 
brakes are far less common but are sometimes prized for their shorter stopping distances 
in wet conditions. As such, these same brake levels may alternatively be described as hav-
ing a normal stopping performance or having a quicker stopping performance in wet con-
ditions. In choosing between these two product descriptions, the researcher is evaluating 
a physical attribute versus a performance benefi t. This choice may be guided by an under-
standing of the target market. For instance, a new bicycle purchaser may not understand 
the differences between pivot brakes and disc brakes but would be able to discriminate 
meaningfully between the value of the two performance descriptions.
Pictorial representations use various visual props or three-dimensional models in solic-
iting participant responses. They hold several advantages over verbal descriptions in that 
the stimulus can be more realistic, the pictorial representations are more likely to commu-
nicate the meaning of different attribute levels accurately, the participants are less likely to 
suffer from information overload in reviewing multiple lists of features, and the task itself 
is more interesting and less fatiguing. The primary disadvantage of pictorial representations 
is in the cost to prepare and present the stimulus.
Measuring the Response 
While our mango juice example required participants to rank their preferences in order, 
preferences can be measured in many other ways. Measurements of preferences can use 
nonmetric means, such as rank ordering or paired comparisons. They can also use metric 
approaches, such as rating scales or ratio scales. Each of these approaches has been inves-
tigated with multiple variations.
In rank-ordering studies, participants typically are provided with a stack of cards 
where each card holds a product description or stimulus presentation. Participants are 
then asked to divide the cards into two piles, preferred and not-preferred, and then repeat 
the procedure starting with the preferred half, moving through the pile until the ranking 
is complete. 
In a paired comparison approach, two products are presented at a time and the par-
ticipant is asked to state her or his preference. See Exhibit 3-6. Its advantage over rank
ordering is its increased reliability in producing results. It suffers, however, in terms of 
the time required to complete the task. A pairwise comparison of n products would 
require n(n 2 1)y2 different choices. For a limited investigation of only fi ve attributes 
at two different levels, a paired comparison would require each participant to make 
45 choices—not the easiest way to assure choice accuracy. Designing a research survey 
with a large number of paired comparisons requires great care. At times, an approach 
known as orthogonal design can be used to reduce the number of paired comparisons 
greatly, while delivering similar accuracy.

Metrics such as rating scales have been adapted by some researchers due to their ease 
of administration. With rating scales, participants are asked to rate their level of interest 
in a product. See Exhibit 3-7. The scale can be continuous, as shown in the exhibit, or 
discrete, such as giving a product a whole-number rating between 1 and 100. Functionally, 
researchers have shown that rating scales and rank ordering can yield similar results under 
many circumstances.
Setting the Evaluation Criterion
One of the more subtle issues in a conjoint analysis study is the criteria that participants 
are asked to use to justify their preferences. Two evaluative criteria commonly requested 
are either a statement of overall preference or intention to buy.
The evaluation criterion used may bias the results of the study inappropriately. For 
instance, consider two potential commuter bicycles: (1) Schwinn World GS, Disc Brakes, 
costing $499; and (2) Trek District, Alloy Dual-Pivot Brakes, costing $929. Research par-
ticipants may, in some sense, prefer the Trek option but, due to lack of fi nancial resources, 
may be more likely to purchase the Schwinn option.
In practice, both preference and likelihood to purchase are used as the evaluation cri-
terion about equally. The intention to purchase evaluations have been identifi ed to be 
particularly suitable for new product classes and services that consumers do not purchase 
currently. These studies help researchers estimate the potential market size for such items. 
When studying more established markets, preference evaluations have been identifi ed to 
be more useful in estimating market shares.

Analyzing the Data 
The type of data analysis that is conducted depends upon the prior decisions regarding 
response type. If rank ordering has been used, then it is appropriate to recognize that 
we don’t really know by how much one alternative is preferred over another. We can only 
analyze the ordering of preferences through techniques such as monotone analysis of vari-
ance (MONANOVA), PREFMAP, or LINMAP. If paired comparisons have been used in 
which participants have been asked to state their probability of choice, LOGIT and PRO-
BIT methods can be used to accommodate the fact that probabilities lie between zero and 
1. If rating scores have been used, the partwise utility system is derived through regression 
analysis such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or minimum sum of absolute errors (MSAE). 
Each of these procedures yields an estimate of the participant’s part-worth utility func-
tions. We will leave it to the interested reader to consult a market research text for greater 
detail about the nature of these data analysis techniques as we attempt to keep this text at 
a level appropriate for the general executive charged with pricing responsibilities.
Summary
• Customer perception–driven pricing has become the dominant approach to 
pricing in many industries. The most popular and academically sound approach to 
measuring customer perceptions of value is conjoint analysis.
• Conjoint analysis, exchange value calculators, and economic price optimization 
are the three dominant approaches to setting prices. Using these three approaches, 
executives can address an overwhelming majority of their price-setting challenges. 
Each of these approaches has been used in both business and consumer markets, 
services and tangible goods markets, and durable and consumable goods 
markets. 
• One of the key issues in selecting a price-setting approach is the market 
maturity. Exchange value calculators tend to dominate price-setting challenges 
with revolutionary products. Conjoint analysis tends to dominate price-setting 
challenges with differentiated and evolutionary markets. Economic price 
optimization tends to dominate pricing discussions for commodity products in 
mature markets.
• In conjoint analysis, researchers measure customer preferences between products. 
The products themselves are treated as a bundle of attributes, features, and 
benefi ts. By measuring their preferences, researchers can detect how customers 
make tradeoffs and quantify the value of different attributes, features, and benefi ts. 
• Part-worth utility functions are identifi ed in a conjoint analysis. Each specifi c 
attribute, feature, or benefi t has a part-worth utility. The overall utility of a product 
is the sum of its part-worth utilities. 
• Dispersion between the part-worth utility functions that customers place on 
different attributes can be used to identify market segments and estimate market 
shares of products serving those market segments.
• Conjoint studies require identifying (1) attribute defi nition, (2) stimulus presentation, 
(3) response measurement, (4) evaluation criterion, and (5) data analysis.
• Attributes can include physical attributes, performance benefi ts, and psychological 
positioning.
• Products can be presented to participants in a variety of ways. The more popular 
forms of stimulus presentation include verbal descriptions, paragraph descriptions, 
or pictorial representations.

Price to Value
• What should we expect to fi nd when we identify products on the price versus value 
plane?
• What does it mean to be priced to value? Value advantaged? Value disadvantaged? 
• Are penetration pricing and skim pricing the only pricing strategies for launching a 
new product?
• When launching a new product, which competitors are most likely to be 
threatened?
• Stretch Question: When considering the use of price versus value to capture market 
share, which approach is more defensible?
F
or every price-setting technique that we have considered, the issue of value has had 
to be considered. In reviewing the results of negotiation exercises, we saw that ne-
gotiators who can transact at a price closer to the reservation value of their coun-
terpart will capture a better price. From the exchange value models, we demonstrated 
the potential to estimate the value that customers will place on a product and argued 
for pricing at or just below the identifi ed exchange value. Setting prices with conjoint 
analysis likewise requires measuring customer preferences to calculate their valuation 
of products and set prices accordingly. Even in economic price optimization, the issue 
of value from the customer’s perspective is important. The demand at any given price is 
a count of the number of customers that value the product at, or more than, the price 
being considered. Thus value, from the customer’s perspective, is the key to pricing.
The importance of pricing in proportion to value is so strong that, in many markets, 
the relationship between value and price is linearly correlated. Higher-valued products are 
sold at higher prices; lower-valued products are sold at lower prices.

Price to Value 
61
From a broad perspective, we can see this relationship with automobile sedans. There is 
a large variation in prices for sedans, ranging from the Tata Nano at $2,500, the  Chevrolet 
Malibu at $28,000, and the Bentley Flying Spur at $170,000, using rough estimates of 
2008 prices. The difference between the lowest-price proposed sedan and the highest-price 
production sedan is nearly a factor of 70. What justifi es this huge price difference? The 
answer is simple: the value delivered in the form of benefi ts. Although both the Tata Nano 
and the Bentley Flying Spur will transport a family of four from A to B, we would be hard-
pressed to fi nd anyone who thinks these two sedans are comparable in terms of benefi ts 
delivered. The Bentley Flying Spur simply delivers far greater benefi ts than the Tata Nano 
could hope to achieve.
Value-based pricing is not just the underpinning of the price-setting methods considered 
so far, it is also the starting point for all refi nements to prices that we will consider in fu-
ture chapters. Pricing to value is a guiding principle in many strategic and tactical pricing 
actions. When launching a new product, repositioning an existing product, or tactically 
discounting a product to capture a specifi c segment, value from customers’ perspectives 
can act as a guide to evaluating the profi tability of the action. Moreover, as we will see 
in Chapter 5, fi rms have some infl uence over customer perception of value, and therefore 
over their prices. 
In this chapter, we will explore pricing to value using a price-to-benefi ts map. From 
this map, we will demonstrate the importance of pricing to value, the potential to price in 
alternative positions, challenges that arise when benefi ts or prices are unclear, and oppor-
tunities for launching a new product within a crowded competitive market.
Price-to-Beneﬁ ts Map
In a price-to-benefi ts map, products are positioned according to their perceived prices on 
the vertical axis against their perceived benefi ts on the horizontal axis.1 It is a visual rep-
resentation of how customers perceive the value tradeoffs. 
Price-to-benefi ts maps are directly related to both exchange value models and conjoint 
analysis. In constructing an exchange value model, executives are estimating the differ-
ential values of products in comparison to relevant competing alternatives. Price setting 
from exchange value models is a simple exercise of identifying a price that approaches the 
management agreed-upon exchange value from below. Likewise, using conjoint analysis, 
executives can detect the differential value of both exiting products and potential new 
product formulations. Moreover, conjoint analysis can reveal how customers perceive the 
value of various attributes, features, and benefi ts. Price setting with conjoint analysis is 
an exercise of identifying the price that customers perceive as leaving them with suffi cient 
value after the transaction to encourage their purchase. Both these techniques encourage 
fi rms to price in proportion to benefi ts. Price-to-benefi ts maps add to these other price-
setting techniques by providing executives with a strategic vantage point into the position 
of their product compared to all the relevant competition.
We can demonstrate a price-to-benefi ts map with the automobile sedan market. In 
designing and positioning the Tata Nano, executives at Tata Motors have deliberately 
attempted to market a sedan that provides little more than basic transportation. Custom-
ers can be expected to perceive the Tata Nano as having both the fewest benefi ts and the 
lowest price of sedans on the market. In contrast, executives at Bentley have deliberately 
strived to deliver the most luxurious sedan on the market with the Flying Spur. They have 
worked to give the Flying Spur superb performance, handling, comfort, sound, and auto-
mation, to name a few dimensions of benefi ts. Customers of the Bentley Flying Spur may 
even perceive that this sedan confers status upon them because of its impressive features. It 
can be expected that customers would perceive the Bentley Flying Spur as having not only

one of the highest prices on the commercial market, but also the highest level of benefi ts 
that can be had in a commercially available sedan. Between these two extremes, there are 
several other sedans such as the Chevrolet Malibu, Lexus LS, and BMW 7 Series. Each of 
these sedans offers different levels of benefi ts in terms of safety, performance, luxury, and 
status. If we were to measure the perceived benefi ts of these sedans and plot them against 
the perceived prices, the results are likely to resemble Exhibit 4-1.
VALUE EQUIVALENCE LINE 
In our sketch of the perceived price against perceived benefi ts in the sedan market, 
products are positioned along a line. This line is called the value equivalence line. See 
Exhibit 4-2. 
For products positioned along the value equivalence line, the benefi ts delivered by a 
product increase in proportion to the prices. Goods that deliver greater benefi ts can be

priced higher, while goods that deliver fewer benefi ts can only capture a lower price. The 
value equivalence line shows the correlation between perceived benefi ts and prices for 
competing products within a market.
The value equivalence line is depicted as lying along a 45-degree angle, but it need not 
be. The angle is somewhat arbitrarily dependent upon the metric of benefi ts. Moreover, the 
value placed on different levels of benefi ts varies between markets. Even within a single 
market, different segments will value the benefi ts differently, causing the slope of the value 
equivalence line to be different between the segments. 
More interesting than the absolute value of the angle of the value equivalence line are 
changes in the slope of the value equivalence line. Changes in the slope of the value equiva-
lence line indicate shifts within customer demand. Market evolutions where new products 
are offered that deliver a different set of benefi ts may affect the perceived tradeoffs be-
tween prices and benefi ts. When these market evolutions drive a change in the slope of 
the value equivalence line, executives of existing products face a challenge in repositioning 
their products and an opportunity to uncover the nature of the new demanded benefi ts 
and deliver an offer that meets customer desires. 
In the simplest approach, executives will use observed market prices and specifi c 
product attributes to defi ne the benefi ts metric in constructing a price-to-value plot.2 
Often however, more thorough effort is required to construct a price-to-value plot. In 
the common situation of executives attempting to resolve a current pricing challenge, 
many researchers suggest using market research to identify the benefi ts metric that is 
best correlated with average selling prices or perceived prices. In less-common situations, 
where executives are searching for subtle changes in customer tastes, some  researchers 
have found that using expert opinions gleaned from product reviews is useful for iden-
tifying the set of benefi ts that account for the greatest proportion of variation in price 
and the variation of this set of benefi ts over time.3 The most appropriate technique for 
drafting the price-to-value plot will depend on the strategic question being addressed 
and the availability of data. Regardless of the technique used to identify the metric of 
perceived benefi ts, the qualitative concept is similar. Prices tend to increase in proportion 
to benefi ts.
ZONE OF INDIFFERENCE
Small variations in perceived price or benefi ts around the value equivalence line often 
have negligible effects on sales volume. Hence, there is a zone of indifference around the 
value equivalence line. Prices of products may be able to increase slightly above the value 
equivalence line without having a measurable effect on sales. For some fi rms, this can serve 
as a costless means to improve profi tability.
The zone of indifference may arise due to the inability of products to exhaust the value 
equivalence line and challenges in customer purchase decisions. In making a purchase, cus-
tomers may be benefi t-bracketed or price-bracketed. Benefi t or price brackets can prevent 
them from easily switching products when alternatives are distant in their position to one 
another on the price-to-benefi ts map.
Benefi ts brackets may arise from customers demanding a particular set of benefi ts that 
are delivered through only a subset of the products within the market. A benefi t fl oor may 
arise from customers requiring a minimal level of benefi ts from the product category to 
warrant a purchase. For instance, a customer may believe that accounting software must 
be able to produce a profi t and loss report or perceive it as having no value over an Excel 
spreadsheet. A benefi ts ceiling can arise from customers who are unable to take advantage 
of certain product features; for instance, some customers may feel that discounted cash 
fl ow analysis is unnecessary within their accounting software.

================================================================================

Chapter 4 
Price to Value
Examples of issues that can give rise to price brackets are budget constraints or cred-
ibility issues. Budgetary constraints may force customers to purchase items below a certain 
level even if they agree that they would gain greater benefi ts if they purchased a higher-
priced product. Customers suffering from budgetary constraints may be forced to “make 
do” with the best available product below a certain price point. Products can also suffer 
from a credibility challenge. Low-priced products may be perceived as having very little 
credible value to warrant any investigation into their benefi ts. High-priced products may 
be perceived to be unable to provide suffi cient credible benefi ts to warrant the price, and 
hence they are also discarded. For many purchasing situations, products are evaluated 
with respect to a zone of credibility. 
If the next nearest competitor in terms of benefi ts delivered is much higher or lower 
than the product under consideration, or if the next nearest competitor in terms of price is 
much higher or lower than the product under consideration, then the price of the product 
may be changed somewhat without having many customers defect to the competing offer 
due to their benefi ts brackets. 
Not all products within all markets will fall within the zone of indifference. Outside 
of the zone of indifference lie the value-advantaged zone and the value-disadvantaged 
zone. Products lying in the value-advantaged or -disadvantaged zones are either priced 
signifi cantly lower or higher than the corresponding levels of benefi ts, as perceived by 
customers.
VALUE ADVANTAGED
Products that deliver far more benefi ts than the price extracted are said to be value
advantaged. Value-advantaged products can be created when fi rms choose to price ag-
gressively, thus providing more benefi ts than expected at a given price, or when a product 
is enhanced with added features and benefi ts but the price is not changed. In either case, 
positioning a product in the value-advantaged area on the price-to-benefi ts map implies 
that the product provides an expected excess value in comparison to the price.
Researchers sometimes refer to products positioned in the value-advantaged area as 
being priced with unharvested value. These researchers believe that positioning a product 
in the value-advantaged area implies that the fi rm could have priced their offering higher. 
Thus, the executives will have failed to harvest the value that they deliver and may have 
committed a pricing error, which failed to maximize profi ts. Examples of unharvested 
value may be found in theatrical performances when tickets for front-row seats are sold 
below that which customers are willing to pay in secondary markets.
Alternatively, positioning a product as value advantaged is sometimes purposely exe-
cuted to take market share. By providing more benefi t than competing products at a given 
price, customers will have an incentive to select that product. 
Despite the potential to improve volumes and market share, executives should refl ect 
carefully on the consequences of positioning a product as value advantaged before execut-
ing this strategy. Deliberately positioning a product as value advantaged can have some 
negative consequences.
When competitors identify a product as value advantaged, they are likely to react in 
various ways. One form of reaction might be to launch a similar product priced at a 
similar level of benefi ts to negate the price-to-benefi ts differential of the value-advantaged 
products. Fortunately, to bring a new product through the product development cycle and 
into a market launch requires time; so the threat of a competitor reacting with the launch 
of a new, similarly benefi t-oriented product may be relatively benign. The more common 
reaction of competitors is simply to drop their prices on existing products, potentially 
initiating an all-out price war. Price wars are not just bad for individual fi rm-level profi ts; 
they tend to harm overall industry health for an extended period as well.

In technology-driven markets, certain product categories may evolve rapidly with se-
quential improvements in benefi ts delivered per price paid, a pattern known as hyper-
competition.4 For instance, DRAM memory costs per kilobyte decrease each time a new 
photolithography technique becomes available. LCD TVs, computer processors, software, 
and nanotech products have all been found to demonstrate similar trajectories. Hyper-
competitive markets are like a bare-knuckle brawl. Firms will price new technology that 
offers signifi cant cost advantages aggressively over legacy technology; that is a common 
trait in these markets. Executives who have performed well in them have focused their 
fi rms on speed of delivery in launching improvements, often relying on a hard learning 
curve for imitators to provide strategic room for maneuvering.
In general, fi rms should not position their product as value advantaged unless they hold 
a concurrent cost advantage or perceive that the action will deliver a future cost advantage 
in the form of an economy of scale, scope, or learning. When the fi rm has a cost advantage 
over its competitors, it may endure a price battle with greater health than the industry’s 
average competitor, enabling it to emerge from a temporary skirmish in a better position. 
Even when executives perceive that they hold a cost advantage, they should take actions 
to minimize the price skirmish, as discussed in Chapter 15.
VALUE DISADVANTAGED
Products that are priced high relative to the benefi ts they deliver are value disadvantaged. 
Value-disadvantaged products can be created when the fi rm positions a product with 
many features and benefi ts at a high price, but customers perceive little value from these 
new attributes. Value-disadvantaged positioning can also arise from changes in the com-
petitive landscape that leave a product misaligned in terms of price and benefi ts. A product 
positioned in the value-disadvantaged area typically suffers from lost market share. 
Researchers sometimes refer to products that are value disadvantaged as suffering from 
missed opportunities. These researchers believe that positioning a product as value disad-
vantaged implies that the fi rm could have sold more units if their prices were more in line 
with the expectations of the market. Thus, the executives will have missed the opportunity 
to capture market attention and may have committed a pricing error that fails to maxi-
mize profi ts. Examples of missed opportunities may be found with media sales situations 
where advertising space goes unsold because its price is too high in comparison to the 
value that it delivers for a segment of potential advertisers.
Alternatively, products may be deliberately positioned as value disadvantaged due to 
a market segmentation strategy. Some segments within the market may prefer a certain 
combination of benefi ts that are not valued by others. A fi rm may attempt to capture that 
segment profi tably by offering a product with those benefi ts and pricing it in proportion 
to the value that the chosen target segments deem worthy of purchase, and yet the market 
overall deems the position to be out of line. For example, both the Bentley Silver Spur and 
the Porsche 911 GT2 are priced relatively high—about $170,000 and $194,000, respec-
tively. The Porsche would be value disadvantaged for a sedan customer while the Bentley 
Silver Spur would be value disadvantaged for the coupe customer. When the market can be 
segmented along the lines of different benefi t categories, it is often best to generate specifi c 
price-to-benefi ts maps for the independent market segments rather than just one for the 
market as a whole to better identify product positioning.
Customer Perceptions 
Because it is customers who purchase products, it is often best to consider product posi-
tions from a customer’s perspective. If customers perceive a product to be priced to value, 
then it will sell in proportion to the number of customers who are willing to pay the 
stated price for that level of benefi ts. If they perceive it to be value advantaged or value

Price to Value
disadvantaged, then the product is likely to capture market attention or fi nd it waning, 
respectively. Customer perceptions matter.
Different customers may hold wildly different perceptions regarding product positions. 
This dispersion may arise from a segmentation strategy, but it often arises due to chal-
lenges in positioning a product. Products that are poorly positioned may fail to capture 
the intended market segment, leaving customers who purchase dissatisfi ed and disinclined 
to repurchase and failing to gain the customers who would have been highly satisfi ed and 
become loyal to the brand in the future. Both dispersions in perceived price and disper-
sions in perceived benefi ts can be a direct result of a failure to manage perceptions. When 
it is, executives may have an opportunity to address the challenge and therefore improve 
their profi tability.
DISPERSION IN PERCEIVED PRICE
When different customers hold contrasting beliefs regarding the price of a product, there 
is a dispersion in perceived price. See Exhibit 4-3. Variations in price perceptions may 
be deliberate due to strategic or tactical decisions, or they may arise from an inability to 
communicate prices accurately. When actual prices are above expected prices, customers 
may delay purchases due to sticker shock, resulting in fewer sales. When actual prices 
are below perceived prices, the level of sales that executives may have hoped to achieve 
may fail to materialize. Keeping price perceptions aligned with actual prices tends to 
improve profi ts.
Structurally, the price of a product might vary widely between different customers. For 
instance, phone tariff structures are often designed to extract a higher price from high-
usage customers than low-usage customers. Likewise, distribution channels and purchase 
locations may drive differences in the price of commonly purchased goods such as carbon-
ated beverages. Structural price variations that support segmentation strategies will drive 
dispersion in the perceived price, but this dispersion in prices usually results in a profi t 
enhancement rather than a positioning challenge. 
Tactically, the price of a product may also vary. Promotional prices and discounting 
policies are ways of refi ning market segmentation efforts through tactical means. Custom-
ers purchasing at the list price will pay a much higher price than those purchasing at a 
sale or discounted price. Tactical price variations that support segmentation efforts may

also result in profi t enhancements. Overused, these tactical price variations can lead to 
positioning challenges as well.
The more persistent challenge in price positioning results from time delays between 
purchasing opportunities. Customers who purchase from a product category infre-
quently may hold inappropriate beliefs regarding the price of products within that cat-
egory. When the prices within a product category are changing rapidly, it will be diffi cult 
to keep price expectations of customers in line with reality. Periods of high infl ation or 
dramatic changes in production costs can lead to price expectations that are misaligned 
with market realities. 
DISPERSION IN PERCEIVED BENEFITS
When different customers hold different beliefs regarding the benefi ts of a product, there 
is dispersion in perceived benefi ts. See Exhibit 4-4. The dispersion in perceived benefi ts 
may result from a structural variation within the market or from a failure of commu-
nication. When actual benefi ts delivered are greater than those perceived, customers 
may place inadequate value on a product and select a competing alternative. When the 
benefi ts are less than what are perceived, the fi rm may be able to capture some sales op-
portunistically, only to fi nd customers defecting quickly to competitor products in future 
purchasing situations. 
The benefi ts of a product may be grounded in functional, process, or relationship issues. 
Functional benefi ts derive from the physical nature or performance characteristics of the 
product itself, such as the square footage of a home, the clarity and size of a gemstone, or 
the ability of a fi nancial software package to create customized invoices. Process benefi ts 
derive from reducing transactional costs by making the product available when and where 
customers desire or reducing search costs in identifying products. Relationship benefi ts 
accrue to customers through their mutually benefi cial relationship with the seller and may 
be created through an emotional connection to the brand or sales representative, loyalty 
programs, or information provisions.
Because different customers may seek a different set of benefi ts from a product cat-
egory, they may also perceive products themselves to hold a different overall level of 
benefi ts. For instance, risk-averse customers may seek assurance and greatly discount 
the claimed benefi ts of a new product. Less-risk-averse customers, however, may value

the benefi ts within a new product precisely because they bring about change. Variations 
in risk aversion have been well observed in technology markets and can result in a time-
dependent segmentation strategy. Similarly, attitudes towards risks vary between senior 
executives and mid-level managers. Senior executives tend to seek dramatic improve-
ments in productivity, while mid-level managers tend to seek stability and steady career 
improvement. 
Perceptions of benefi ts may vary between customers due to poor marketing com-
munications. When different marketing communications efforts tout different sets of 
benefi ts, customers may have a hard time developing a common understanding of the 
benefi ts delivered through a product. When a wide disparity in perceived benefi ts is 
indicative of customer confusion, executives may have the opportunity to clarify their 
marketing communications and increase the level of communications to drive sales 
and profi ts. 
Wide dispersions of perceived benefi ts are more common with experience and cre-
dence goods than search goods. Search goods are items that allow for a functional 
comparison between competing products during the shopping experience itself. For in-
stance, prior to purchasing an automobile, customers can compare engine size, tires, 
entertainment systems, suspensions, braking systems, and other features to predict the 
benefi ts of the automobile. Bicycles, home appliances, and some software products are 
all examples of search goods. Through feature descriptions and promotional statements, 
customers can make comparisons between products prior to purchase with search 
goods. Experience goods are items in which the full knowledge of the benefi ts can be 
gained only from past experience with the product. For example, with newspapers, it is 
hard to tell the value of the content until after the news is read, and only through expe-
rience with the brand can a customer form meaningful expectations of the newspaper’s 
value. Entertainment and other forms of media, along with some forms of beverages 
and branded clothing, are examples of experience goods. Credence goods are items in 
which the benefi ts are unknown and may never be known. For instance, the purchase 
of insurance is done with the expectation that reimbursement will come following a 
disaster. However, few customers of insurance products hope for a disaster, and most 
try to avoid them. If the insured disaster never comes, the insurance policy will expire 
and go unused, thus the buyer will never truly know if the policy was worth anything. 
Other credence goods includes prepurchased funerary service (it is hard to evaluate 
the benefi ts of a service provided after the customer is dead), prostate cancer care (it is 
 diffi cult to ascertain whether slow-growing prostate cancer will kill the patient or some 
other disease will fi rst), and product warranties. People purchase credence items on the 
belief that the fi rm providing them will actually deliver the benefi ts, even if the customer 
is unaware of it doing so.
DISPERSION IN BOTH PERCEIVED PRICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS
Some products suffer from both wide dispersions in price and benefi ts perceptions. See 
Exhibit 4-5. When customers are uncertain regarding the position of a product, the market 
is simply confused. Customers who seek a high level of benefi ts and are willing to pay for 
them may mistakenly purchase a lower-priced good. In this case, not only will the fi rm 
have missed an opportunity to sell a higher-priced product, but also the customer may 
become dissatisfi ed. Alternatively, customers who would be satisfi ed with a lower level 
of benefi ts at a lower price may mistakenly perceive that the market does not provide 
an appropriate product and therefore refuse to purchase any product. As both types of 
misalignment between expectations and reality illustrate, a wide dispersion in perceived 
benefi ts and prices can lead to reduced sales, reduced customer loyalty, and ultimately 
reduced profi ts.

New Product Positioning
Executives can use the price-to-benefi ts map to identify opportunities for launching a new 
product within an existing market.5 Potential positions within the price-to-benefi ts map 
can be considered. With each position, the price-to-benefi ts map will reveal the customer-
addressable horizon to executives. The customer-addressable horizon is the source of the 
customers for the new product. Some of the new customers would have been previously pur-
chasing a product at a higher price-and-benefi ts position; others would have been purchas-
ing a product at a lower price-and-benefi ts position. Identifying the customer-addressable 
horizon can be used to estimate the market share and sales volume for the new product.
Uncovering the customer-addressable horizon can also be used to anticipate competitor 
reactions. Any new product that takes sales away from competing products can encour-
age a competitive response. Executives can be prepared to address a competitor’s response 
by considering the circumstances under which they will accommodate the competitive 
maneuver, respond to the competitive action, or withdraw from the market. 
There are eight major factors that can be evaluated to gauge the likelihood of a competi-
tive response to a new product. 6 (1) Competitors with a strategic intent to stay in the market 
due to a strong profi t margin on a product that is threatened by the new entry are more 
likely to defend their position than those who may be looking for a way out of the industry. 
(2) Competitors that have made recent investments within the industry are likewise likely 
to respond to an encroachment upon their price-to-benefi ts position. (3) In contrast, com-
petitors whose range of options for responding is limited due to cost challenges or inability 
to match the new entry’s benefi ts may be unlikely to respond. (4) Likewise, fi rms in strong 
fi nancial health may perceive that they can be patient in responding to measure the true ef-
fect of the new entry. (5) In general, the greater the level of threat a competitor perceives the 
new entry to represent, the greater the response will be. New entries will threaten products 
that are nearer in position more than they will those who are more distant. (6) Similarly, 
the overall market position of existing competitors will also affect their decision to respond. 
Competitors that are already value disadvantaged face a greater urgency in responding than 
those who are value advantaged. Other factors that may indicate the likelihood and type of 
competitive response include industry maturity and tradition. (7) Competitors with greater 
maturity will have experienced multiple business cycles and might be expected to respond 
more appropriately. (8) Similarly, industry tradition may reveal patterns of competitive

actions, such as a tendency to innovate or avoid price wars or conversely to defend share 
aggressively. Such patterns can be anticipated to be repeated.
Strategically, a new product can be launched as price neutral with respect to other 
products, or it can take a non-neutral position through a penetration-pricing or price-
skimming strategy. Each of these approaches has its benefi ts and drawbacks, as we will 
explore in the rest of this chapter.7 
PRICE-NEUTRAL POSITIONING
When a new product is priced within the zone of indifference, the fi rm has taken a price-
neutral position. From a price-neutral position, the fi rm has negated the potential to use price 
as a means to capture market share. To capture customers, executives place pressure on other 
marketing factors, such as promotion or distribution, when positioned as price neutral. 
Neutral pricing is a strong competitive move when there is an opening in the price-to-
benefi ts map. An open gap within the middle of the zone of indifference may imply an op-
portunity to better serve a portion of the market than existing products have done so far. 
Openings at the top of the zone of indifference may exist when new benefi ts become possible 
that were previously thought to be unattainable, or when the market expands suffi ciently to 
warrant further segmentation. For instance, the fortunes of Robert Mondavi Winery have 
tracked the growing interest in wines within the United States for more than forty years since 
the 1960s by continually focusing on improving the quality of their wines and pricing them 
appropriately to the upper end of the market. Alternatively, openings at the bottom of the 
zone of indifference may become available when customers begin to seek greater simplicity 
in their purchases, as U.S. consumers did in the aftermath of the 2008–2009 Great Recession. 
Positioning a new product as price neutral is generally the safest approach to avoiding 
a negative competitive response. When a competitive response is made to a price-neutral 
launch, it is most likely to be from a competitor that markets a product positioned closest 
to the new entry. See Exhibit 4-6. Positioning a product at the bottom or within the middle 
of the zone of indifference is subject to the potential of a competitive response in the form 
of a price decrease on existing products. The likelihood of a price response is tempered by 
the need for competitors to maintain contribution margins, not just volumes. Entering a 
product category positioned at the top of the zone of indifference usually grants the fi rm 
some leeway in that a competitive response will be slowed due to the challenges faced in 
delivering a product with similar benefi ts.

PENETRATION PRICING
If a new product is launched within an existing market at a low price in comparison
to the benefi ts that it delivers, the fi rm is executing a penetration-pricing strategy. See 
Exhibit 4-7. Penetration pricing is undertaken to gain market share quickly. It is risky in 
many cases because there may be little to prevent existing competitors from dropping their 
prices as well to thwart the new entrant from gaining a foothold. Executives who choose 
to practice penetration pricing when launching a new product are often wise to treat it as 
a tactical price promotion for introducing the new product rather than a strategic resetting 
of the price level.
Often, in rapidly evolving high-tech industries, penetration pricing arises from increas-
ing the level of benefi ts while leaving the price unchanged. This occurs due to cost ad-
vantages being gained concurrent to benefi ts improvements with the adoption of new 
manufacturing techniques. If executives can sustain a rate of improvement greater than its 
competitors’ for several release cycles, penetration pricing may enable the fi rm to capture 
a dramatic amount of share. 
From a promotional perspective, penetration pricing obviously generates customer in-
terest. However, this position may be deleterious for the fi rm, not only in failing to capture 
potential contribution margins but also in strongly encouraging a competitive response. 
The most likely direct response is a price decrease by competitors to bring all products 
back to parity within a price-to-benefi ts tradeoff.
PRICE SKIMMING
If the new product is launched within an existing market at a high price in compari-
son to the benefi ts that it delivers, the fi rm is executing a price-skimming strategy. See
Exhibit 4-8. Price skimming is undertaken to capture profi ts from early customers with 
the expectation of lowering prices at a future time. It is unlikely to incur any competitive 
response because the new entry will be perceived as relatively benign. However, such a 
position is usually the result of a pricing error that results in lower sales volumes and 
forgone profi ts. 
Products launched under a price-skimming strategy fail to provide most customers with 
suffi cient motivation to purchase given the alternatives; hence, they may not gain market 
attraction. Firms may use this strategy to explore a market strategically, but few executives 
should expect this initial thrust to deliver signifi cant results.

SUMMARY
• A price-to-benefi ts map plots the position of the competing products with respect 
to perceived price and perceived benefi ts. 
• Products in which perceived price increases with perceived benefi ts lie on the value 
equivalence line. Around the value equivalence line may lay a zone of indifference 
where small changes in price have a negligible effect on demand.
• Products that are perceived to provide excess benefi ts with respect to price 
are said to be value advantaged. Value-advantaged positioning is usually 
undertaken to take market share, but it represents a choice to leave some value 
unharvested.
• Products that are perceived to provide insuffi cient benefi ts with respect to 
their perceived price are said to be value disadvantaged. Value-disadvantaged 
positioning usually comes at the cost of missed opportunities and reduction in 
market share.
• Dispersion in perceived price can be driven by strategic and tactical variations in 
price or misperceptions of price.
• Dispersion in perceived benefi ts can be driven by different segments placing 
different importance on different benefi ts, or misperceptions of benefi ts 
delivered.
• Large dispersion in perceived price, benefi ts, or both can lead to customers 
purchasing suboptimally, leading to both missed profi t opportunities and customer 
dissatisfaction.
• To launch a new product within the zone of indifference is to assume a price-neutral 
position. Price-neutral positioning tends to apply pressure on the remaining marketing 
levers of promotion and distribution.
• Launching a new product at a low price in comparison to its benefi ts is penetration 
pricing. Penetration pricing tends to use price itself as a means to gain market 
share.
• Launching a new product at a high price in comparison to benefi ts is price 
skimming.

General Motors: Price Management in Summer 2007
An illustration of the strategic value of a price-to-benefi ts map can be found from some of 
the pricing dynamics in the U.S. auto industry. As an industry practice, auto manufacturers 
have offered summer incentives to customers to clear unsold inventory and prepare dis-
tribution channels for the next year’s models. The depth and duration of these discounts 
have implications for the profi tability of both the manufacturers and distributors. 
Distributors should prefer deeper manufacturer discounts over a longer period of 
time to increase sales volume. Manufacturers should prefer more limited discounts, both 
in duration and depth, because the cost of the discount comes directly from the manu-
facturer’s profi tability. Because the manufacturer’s discount disproportionately affects 
the manufacturer’s profi t over the distributors’, there is a natural point of confl ict that 
requires negotiation.
Going into the summer of 2007, General Motors (GM) had made clear statements 
regarding its strategic intent to reduce discounting across the board.8 Reducing dis-
counts, however, cannot be confused with eliminating discounts. GM did provide 
 discounts, but the duration of its summer discounting was shorter than that of its 
industry cohorts.
Early in the summer of 2007, GM’s competitors offered a range of summer discounts 
like those from Toyota for 0 percent fi nancing for 60 months or rebates on purchases. 
GM, however, delayed its summer incentives until later in the summer. By delaying its 
incentives, GM may have been taking advantage of fl uctuations in the width of the zone 
of indifference while simultaneously managing to remain aligned with industrywide 
pricing practices. It can be argued that this strategy enabled GM to increase its ability to 
target its discounts toward its more loyal customers. 
Conceptually, we can show this dynamic in Exhibit 4-9. Let us assume that auto man-
ufacturers, such as GM, Toyota, Ford, and Chrysler, had priced their products somewhat 
along the value equivalence line going into the summer of 2007. Once GM’s competitors 
had released their summer incentives, those competitors would have been priced below 
the value equivalence line. However, not all customers will have noticed the change in 
the price-to-benefi ts of all vehicles at the same time. More-vigilant customers would 
have noticed that GM was effectively priced somewhat higher than its competitors, 
while the less vigilant may not have noticed. The initial result of the summer incentives is 
a temporary broadening of the zone of indifference as some customers perceive the price 
change and others fail to notice. This temporary broadening of the zone of equivalence 
created some leeway for GM to delay its summer incentives. 
Eventually, all customers will have noticed that GM had not yet provided any sum-
mer discounts. Once the customer perceptions had adjusted to the new reality, GM 
would have been priced above the zone of indifference. At this point, GM would have 
had few other options for staying competitive with its industry cohorts outside of pro-
viding similar summer incentives. Once GM did, its position was brought back within 
the new zone of indifference.
From a strategic viewpoint, it can be argued that GM’s delay in summer incentives 
might have been able to improve its long-term fi nancial health. The customers who 
would have noticed that GM did not offer summer discounts early are likely to be those 
who were shopping for a GM product in particular, rather than those shopping for an 
automobile in general. These customers could be said to be more loyal to the GM brand, 
and hence they were more valuable to the GM corporation. Even though they are loyal 
customers and may be willing to wait a short while for GM’s summer incentives, their 
patience would not be infi nite. By delaying, GM may have been able to target its incen-
tive program to its more loyal customers, who had delayed their purchases in anticipa-
tion of the summer incentives.

Psychological Influences 
on Price Sensitivity
• Why do prices end in 9?
• If private transactions are just that—private—why do customers care what others 
paid?
• How do customers perceive prices and offerings?
• Are there inherent biases that infl uence the perception of value and price?
• Can a fi rm infl uence a customer’s perception of the value?
• Stretch Question: Is the best price always the one that accurately refl ects value?
I
n many ways, value is a subjective matter. The perception of value is inherently de-
pendent upon how the customer perceives the product, the benefi ts it offers, and their 
alternatives. This perception of value and to some extent the perception of price are 
subject to many psychological infl uences. Executives who understand these infl uences can 
better gauge the limits of their pricing power and the responses of customers to price ac-
tions. Moreover, they may be able to uncover means of infl uencing customers’ perceptions 
of value and price and therefore improve their pricing power.

Chapter 5 
Psychological Influences on Price Sensitivity
The dominant approaches to setting prices that we explored have each been built upon 
the common pillar of value. Prices should be set in proportion to the value that custom-
ers perceive a product delivers. However, these approaches have not fully addressed how 
customers perceive value.
Consider exchange value models as an example. Exchange value models inform execu-
tives of the potential value within a product based on the benefi ts that executives quantify. 
An incomplete list of benefi ts would lead executives to believe that they must charge a 
lower price, while a list of benefi ts that the market does not perceive as relevant would 
lead them to price the product higher than what the market will bear. Determining which 
benefi ts should be quantifi ed and determining the best means to quantify the value of a 
specifi c benefi t can be improved by understanding the needs of customers, but will remain, 
to some extent, a subjective decision. Furthermore, once an exchange value model has 
identifi ed the range of a good price, it leaves the challenge of convincing customers that the 
value of the product is near the price revealed by the exchange value model to be managed 
through other means. Convincing customers of the value revealed by an exchange value 
model shifts the pricing challenge from one of setting prices to one of communicating 
value. Marketing communication and sales professionals must confront certain decision-
making biases of customers to facilitate transactions at the prices determined through the 
exchange value model. By understanding the psychological infl uences of price sensitivity, 
these executives will be better able both to address the decision biases of customers and 
perhaps to encourage customers to increase their perception of value.
Similarly, conjoint analysis may reveal the current perceived value of a product, and yet 
it may not fully describe why customers perceive the product in that manner nor how to 
adjust customer perceptions. Consumers’ opinions regarding acceptable prices for a product 
are themselves dependent upon what they know, how they think, and the attitudes they hold. 
Each of these issues can be infl uenced by actions that the fi rm can take. 
Pricing is only one of the marketing levers under a fi rm’s control. Executives also 
 manage the other marketing variables of brand positioning, advertising intensity, distribu-
tion, and product defi nition. These other marketing variables can themselves infl uence the
optimal pricing strategy.
For instance, one of the primary purposes of branding is to reduce price sensitivity. 
Lowering price sensitivity is the same as lowering the elasticity of demand; that is, price 
changes have a disproportionately smaller effect on sales volume when customers are 
less price-sensitive than when they are more price-sensitive. We have seen that products 
facing a lower elasticity of demand can increase prices to improve profi tability. Thus, good 
branding can lead to better prices.
In contrast, increased price sensitivity is the same as increasing the elasticity of demand. 
We have also seen that fi rms facing elastic demand have an incentive to lower prices to 
increase profi tability and have argued that such actions tend to lead to price wars between 
competitors, which lower overall industry profi tability. Very few fi rms can profi t in an un-
healthy industry. Therefore, executives should be aware of the infl uences that may increase 
price sensitivity and avoid actions that may give rise to their importance.
Numerous factors infl uence how customers perceive value and price.1 While some of 
these factors are more properly considered economic in nature, many arise from deeper, 
psychological infl uences, and perhaps even arise from evolutionary biological forces in 
their development and expression in human behavior. 
Executives can use a deeper understanding of these psychological infl uences to over-
come decision-making biases of themselves and their customers. In some cases, pricing 
professionals can use an understanding of decision-making biases in purchasing behavior 
to clarify the limits of their pricing power and uncover new approaches to pricing, which 
reduces psychological dissonance within customers and therefore improves the acceptance 
of their pricing practices by the market.

Psychological Influences on Price Sensitivity

The psychological infl uences on price sensitivity may be as much a result of how the 
brain works as it is a result of cold rational factors regarding economic welfare.  Recent 
studies that examine brain activity during economic decisions have led to a neuro economic 
understanding of how customers make purchase decisions.2 Some of these studies  indicate 
that these psychological infl uences are not simply a function of customers misunderstand-
ing the economics of an offer but rather derive from evolutionary biological forces.3 
In one model of the human psychology of purchase decisions, the brain is viewed as a 
prediction machine that continuously generates predictions about what to expect in the 
environment. These continuous predictions are extremely rapid and depend on similari-
ties between novel inputs and the closest familiar representations stored in memory. For 
example, if you see a chair that you have never seen before, you can still determine what 
it is, its function, approximate weight, expected price, and other nonvisual characteristics. 
To derive these expectations rapidly, we rely on surprisingly little information. Neural 
circuits may mediate the vital mental skills that translate information into impressions, 
preferences, judgments, and predictions.4
Many psychological infl uences on price sensitivity can be derived from the tendency for 
human beings to be cognitive misers who develop heuristics for accelerating decisions. As 
cognitive misers, we attempt to store as little information as possible and make decisions 
with as little information as possible. To improve our decisions with minimal effort, we 
develop heuristics, or decision shortcuts, that have a tendency to be accurate—although, 
at times, they are completely inaccurate. 
While these models of human psychology are extremely intriguing and create excellent 
fodder for understanding purchasing behavior, our understanding of these effects is still in 
its nascent stages. Moreover, executives require a more distilled description of these infl u-
ences than those provided by pure neuroeconomics. As we understand these forces more 
deeply, we can expect pricing to become even more nuanced and their infl uence on pricing 
decisions to become more codifi ed.
In this chapter, we will examine some of the better-researched infl uences and consumer 
behavioral effects on price perceptions. Some of the factors will lead to an increase in price 
sensitivity, while others will decrease it. Some of the factors can be infl uenced by the fi rm’s 
actions, but others may not. All will help executives understand their pricing power, and 
therefore may help guide pricing decisions.
While some researchers have attempted to collect all of these infl uences in a unifi ed 
theory, these approaches have fallen short of providing suffi cient breadth to capture the 
breadth of infl uences. As an alternative, we group infl uences as being related to true eco-
nomic costs, related to perceptual challenges, encapsulated in prospect theory, or related 
to prospect theory. While we accept that this grouping is likely to be imperfect, we believe 
that it will enable better understanding.
True Economic Costs
There are several effects that are often discussed with respect to human psychology and 
can be properly placed within the context of a rational decision maker making an eco-
nomic decision. As we will see, these effects derive from implicit economic costs that come 
in form of opportunity costs or hidden costs. 
SHARED COST EFFECT
The shared cost effect denotes the reduction of price sensitivity found when customers 
use other people’s money to pay for a product. For instance, business travelers often 
receive full reimbursement for travel expenses from their companies. Airline loyalty

Chapter 5 
Psychological Influences on Price Sensitivity
programs enable airlines to increase prices marginally because the price is paid by the 
business but the choice of airline is infl uenced by the traveler. To a lesser degree, rebates 
tend to lower price sensitivity due to the partial payment of the product through the 
rebate. 
One way of describing the shared cost effect is that people spend from four funds of 
money.5 (1) People spend their own money on themselves. When they do so, they pay high 
attention to gaining utility from the product and getting the most utility per dollar spent. 
(2) People spend their own money on someone else. When they do so, they are seeking 
to maximize the utility of the gift recipient as well as maximize their utility in giving the 
gift. Thus, they remain price-sensitive, but the defi nition of utility changes. (3) People 
spend someone else’s money on themselves. In this case, customers will be more benefi t-
oriented, but less price-sensitive, than when spending their own money on themselves 
or someone else. (4) People spend someone else’s money on someone else, such as when 
buying products for a business. In the absence of decision-making oversight and proper 
incentives, people spending someone else’s money on someone else are neither very price- 
nor benefi t-sensitive.
SWITCHING COSTS
When customers change brands or adapt a new technology, they will incur a switching 
cost. Switching costs arise from product-specifi c investments that buyers make. 6 Switch-
ing costs can be psychological, such as the value that customers place on remaining loyal 
to a trusted brand. More tangibly, switching costs can be fi scal in nature. For instance, 
customers may purchase complementary goods to enhance the benefi ts of a core product, 
and switching to a new brand may drive them to reinvest in new complementary products. 
Alternatively, business processes may need to be restructured to reap the benefi ts of a new 
technology. Similarly, customers may have to invest in learning a new technology to use it, 
and the time spent learning creates a further switching cost. 
Firms that increase switching costs fi nd that their customers will be less price-sensitive. 
Firms that reduce the switching costs of a competitor’s customers may also fi nd the market 
less price-sensitive toward their offer. Switching costs can be factored into exchange value 
models and segmentation studies from conjoint analysis to better understand the willingness 
to pay of existing customers and contrast it with that of potentially new customers.
EXPENDITURE EFFECT
Some researchers have argued that customers are more price-sensitive at higher prices due 
to economic incentive to identify savings.7 For instance, people may shop more intensely 
for high-expenditure items than they do for low-expenditure items. This expenditure effect 
arises from opportunity costs. Shopping, comparing offers, and making decisions require 
the investment of time and effort, both of which could be used doing something else. 
These investments of time and effort are forms of opportunity costs. With high-expendi-
ture items, the opportunity cost of shopping is a small portion of the total purchase cost. 
With low-expenditure items, the opportunity cost of shopping is a large portion of the 
total purchase cost. As such, an economically rational customer should spend more time 
shopping for expensive items than for inexpensive items. 
In consumer markets, these researchers have argued that the magnitude of the expen-
diture as a proportion to the household income is a strong indicator of price sensitivity. 
Households with lower income will be more price-sensitive with large-expenditure items 
than households with higher income. In business markets, these researchers have argued that 
the magnitude of the expenditure effect is moderated by the absolute size of the purchase 
and the importance of the expenditure to the strategic direction of the business. Products 
that are correlated with the strategic direction of the fi rm are more likely to be subject to

alternative discovery and price comparisons than those more related to standard business 
inputs. Likewise, products that require a higher absolute expenditure are subject to greater 
management scrutiny and are therefore also subject to higher levels of price sensitivity.
However, it is uncertain as to if customers are consistently more price-sensitive with 
high-expenditure products than they are for low-expenditure products. Some research 
has uncovered contradictory evidence which demonstrates that the expenditure effect is 
moderated by the manner in which savings are presented. For instance, compare the reac-
tion to a $5 savings when shopping for a low-priced item such as a $39.99 microwave 
oven versus a high-priced item such as a $499.99 fl at-screen TV. Telling customers that 
the same microwave can be found at a store 2 miles away for $5 less tends to encourage 
more customers to defect to the alternative outlet in comparison to telling customers that 
the same TV can be found 2 miles away for $5 less. This counter expenditure effect will be 
somewhat explained through prospect theory.
DIFFICULT COMPARISON EFFECT
The opportunity costs related to shopping also give rise to the diffi cult comparison effect. 
Firms can, at times, alter customers’ perceptions of competing offers in their favor by mak-
ing it diffi cult for them to compare prices or compare benefi ts. 8 There are three main areas 
where the diffi cult comparison effect can be found: Incumbent/New Entrant Rivalry, Brands 
vs. Generics, and Size Changes.
Incumbent/New Entrant Rivalry
The diffi cult comparison effect is often used by incumbents as a means of defending mar-
ket share against new entrants. This strategy works to the incumbents’ advantage for two 
reasons. First, by making comparisons diffi cult, the information-gathering requirements of 
potential product switchers is increased. By increasing the information-gathering costs of 
customers, product switchers have an economic incentive to stay with their current brand. 
Second, by making comparisons diffi cult, marketers can increase uncertainty within cus-
tomers. Customers that are uncertain regarding the net benefi ts of switching products tend 
to stay with their current trusted brand rather than explore an uncertain new brand rela-
tionship. These two factors explain much of the effort by incumbents to obfuscate the price 
and benefi ts of their offerings. In contrast, new entrants tend to make price comparisons as 
explicit as possible to facilitate rational decision making and brand switching.
An example of the diffi cult comparison effect being used strategically by incumbents 
and being attacked by new entrants can be found in the 2002–2009 confl ict between 
Vonage and AT&T. AT&T’s basic residential telephone service was priced low, but any 
advanced services such as long distance calls, call waiting, call forwarding, caller ID, and 
three-way calling were available only through additional purchases. Customers selecting 
a calling plan based on the price that they should expect to pay for services would have a 
diffi cult time calculating their expected bill due to the numerous factors that determined 
a bill from AT&T. To some extent, AT&T’s price structure may have been purposely
designed to make price comparisons with alternative service providers diffi cult. By making 
comparisons diffi cult, reluctant brand switchers are encouraged to stick with AT&T rather 
than risk uncovering new, higher phone bills with an unknown Voice over Internet Proto-
col (VOIP) provider with uncertain call quality. In the years leading into 2009, Vonage has 
been advertising complete national home telephone service for a fl at fee of $24.99, which 
includes many of the features that AT&T sells only through additional contracts. In these 
advertisements, Vonage has explicitly contrasted its simple, fl at price structure with that of 
AT&T. Vonage has also touted the quality of its VOIP services. Vonage’s attempt to make 
price and benefi ts comparisons as clear as possible has been necessary to facilitate brand 
switching.

Brands vs. Generics
At times, a nationally branded product and a generic or store brand product may be identical 
in every physical dimension except name and label. For instance, two pain relievers may be 
chemically identical in terms of active ingredients but are named differently. Likewise, table salt 
may be sold in both a branded form and unbranded form but fundamentally be the same entity. 
In many cases, customers will tend to purchase the branded form of these items, and moreover 
they will tend to be willing to pay more for the branded form of these items, even though they 
may rationally know that the two products are identical. 
Brands imbue products with trust. Because of this trust, many customers will be reluc-
tant to betray a brand in favor of its generic equivalent. Even though the generic equiva-
lent provides the same physical benefi ts at a lower price, it fails to provide the emotional 
security sought by many customers and may be perceived as the riskier alternative. Hence, 
the brand itself makes comparisons between items diffi cult. 
Recent inroads by hard discounters and improvements in generic offerings in general 
have reduced the value of many brands. As consumers increasingly learn to trust generics, 
the diffi cult comparison effect that enables branded goods to be priced higher than their 
generic equivalent will be reduced. 
Size Changes
The third approach to using the diffi cult comparison effect is in obfuscating parity  relationships 
by changing the size related to offers. For instance, at bars in Prague one orders beers by size 
and not brand for most bars offer only one brand of beer. A typical offering in 2006 was 
a large beer for 20 CzK or a small beer for 14 CzK. On the face of it, a small beer appears 
cheaper. However, a large beer provides 0.5 liters of beer, making the unit costs 4.0 CzK 
per deciliter, while a small beer is only 0.3 liters of beer, making the unit costs 4.7 CzK per 
 deciliter. On a per deciliter basis, a large beer is less expensive than a small beer. In this case, 
the diffi cult comparison effect enables the supplier to provide the product at a higher per unit 
price but at a lower perceived price.
Perceptual Challenges
Some infl uences to the customer acceptance of prices arise from more purely psychologi-
cal issues, such as the adherence to social norms or the misapplication of decision-making 
rules. 
PRICES ENDING IN 9
One of the best understood infl uences in pricing is the tendency to end prices in the digit 9. 
If price endings were randomly distributed, we would expect that prices would end in each 
digit about 10 percent of the time. Observation alone would indicate that this is not the 
case. A frequency analysis of retail price endings from 0 to 9 reveals that prices overwhelm-
ingly tend to end in 9, and less so in 5 and 0.9 See Exhibit 5-1. Researchers have uncovered 
many psychological infl uences that explain why fi rms may profi t from this tendency.
The psychological effects that lead to the tendency to bias price endings are so strong, 
they even extend well beyond the last, rightmost digit. For instance, consider the consumer 
market reaction to odd price points, such as the difference between pricing a product at 
$24.99, $28.59, or $29.99. While the lowest price, $24.99, tends to lead to more sales 
than either higher price, as predicted by a downward sloping demand curve, an odd obser-
vation is associated with the somewhat unusual middle price point, $28.59 in many con-
sumer markets, versus the more culturally accepted normal price of $29.99. Products tend 
to sell better when priced at “normal” prices, like $29.99, over odd prices, like $28.59, 
even though the normal price is slightly higher than the odd price. This kink in the demand

curve is a direct contradiction of standard economic theory and can best be explained by 
examining psychological infl uences. 
The common, but discredited, hearsay reason for ending prices in 9 is due to a historical 
artifact relating odd pricing and shrinkage at the cash register. The belief was that even-
priced merchandise would often be paid in cash with the exact amount, allowing clerks 
to pocket the cash. By using odd amounts, clerks would have to use the cash register to 
make change, thus making the pocketing of the customer receipts obvious to shoppers as 
well as bookkeepers who would later review the cash register tally. However, if this habit 
were only a bookkeeping tendency that stuck, then all odd price endings would be more 
common than the price endings with the digit 0. We see from the data that clearly there is 
more going on in price setting than would arise from a historical artifact. 
The tendency to end prices in 9 may be infl uenced by the relationship between cognitive 
accessibility and comparative shopping. Round digits, such as 0 and 5, are easily stored 
and retrieved from memory due to their familiarity. Thus, prices that end in 0 and 5 will 
be more easily perceived, encoded into memory, and recalled during a comparison shop-
ping effort. As such, round digits such as 0 and 5 may facilitate price comparisons while 
odd digits, such as 9s, may hamper efforts at price comparison. When customers compare 
prices between outlets, their increased ability to recall prices may also lead to increased 
price sensitivity. To reduce price sensitivity, shopkeepers may have intuitively learned the 
value of underrepresenting these round price endings and have chosen 9s instead. 
Another source of encouragement for price endings in 9s may result from the percep-
tion of discounts that they tend to impart. Humans may frame a price ending in 9s as a 
small discount from the next higher round number. (The framing effect will be discussed in 
more detail later in this chapter in the “Framing Effect” section.) This discount represents 
a small gain in utility that may mildly encourage a purchase due to deeper psychological 
reasons. 
Related to these prior insights is the issue of the meaning that the price ending im-
parts.10 Prices ending in 9 tend to imply a relatively low price or a discounted price, thus 
stimulating demand. Unfortunately, prices ending in 9 may also communicate an unfavor-
able impression relating to quality due to the inferences that customers make regarding

lower or discounted prices and their implication of lower quality. In contrast, prices end-
ing in 0 are suspected to imply quality and tend to be used in retail outlets with a classier 
image. This observation partially explains the tendency for posters to be sold at prices that 
end in 9, while fi ne art galleries tend to price their paintings in whole numbers. 
Much discussed is the underestimation effect invoked by pricing at levels such as $9.99 
rather than $10.11 The underestimation effect is explained by considering how numbers 
are encoded and the tendency of human beings to be cognitive misers. Within the  Arabic
 numeral system, people encode numbers from left to right. Furthermore, the most  important 
digits are always on the left. Meanwhile, customers are cognitive misers that attempt to 
manage as much information with as little effort as possible. Time-pressed and cognitively 
busy customers attempting to make decisions regarding value, alternatives, and tradeoffs 
will develop heuristics, or decision shortcuts, to accelerate their purchase decisions. One such 
heuristic might be to read only the most important, leftmost digit and discard the  remaining 
digits when evaluating prices. The result will be an illusion of a lower price, which makes 
a product with a price ending in 9 seem much less expensive than the next nearest, and 
higher, round number.
As may be inferred, many of these psychological infl uences on price endings are cultur-
ally dependent. While prices endings in 9 are common in most Western countries, some 
cultures have tended to use alternative digit endings. For instance, prices ending in 5 were 
observed to be overrepresented in Poland shortly after perestroika liberalized much of the 
Soviet bloc. The Polish tendency toward 5s has been attributed to the confrontational bar-
gaining position of an ex-Soviet Poland that led Polish consumers to perceive prices ending 
in 9 as a loss above the lower round number rather than as a gain from a higher round 
number.12 In contrast, prices ending in 8s were found to be overrepresented in Asian coun-
tries, including Japan. For Asian cultures, the number 8 is associated with luck and prosperity, 
thus likely affording the product some attribution of good fortune as well.13
THE FAIRNESS EFFECT
In any transaction, customers expect to be treated fairly. Moreover, customers tend to feel 
as though they have been treated unfairly when the price that they are charged is different 
from the price that someone else may have to pay. While many have argued on philosophi-
cal grounds that the issue of fairness should be dismissed in a free market because free 
markets allow exactly that—freedom to participate—these arguments tend to go against 
the grain of human behavior and may be counter to our evolutionary biology. 
Current economic theory is structured on the basis of self-interest as the primary
motivator for any transaction. If the price of a product is higher than the benefi ts deliv-
ered, customers are free not to purchase it in a free market. Likewise, if it is too low for a 
business to profi t, the fi rm is free not to offer the product. Between these two levels, any 
transaction price is deemed fair. However, such a cursory examination of fairness in pric-
ing does an executive a grave disservice. It not only ignores many behavioral economic 
studies but can lead to a corporate disaster.
Findings in brain physiology, especially evolutionary neuroscience, show that the part 
of our brain that engages in commercial transaction decisions evolved from the interplay 
of our self-preservational (egoistic) and affectional (empathetic) neural circuitries.14 Thus, 
sharing activities, such as those within families or those associated with gift giving to 
friends, and commercial activities, such as those involved in transactions, both rely upon 
the same physiological cognitive functions. The presence of sharing motives in commercial 
transactions may drive expectations of fairness with respect to prices. 
A common way in which fairness affects pricing is that customers perceive prices as fair 
when they are within expectations based on past interactions with the category.15 Large 
price increases can be perceived as “profi t taking” on behalf of suppliers and producers, or

as taking advantage of less-powerful customers. Likewise, prices that are perceived to vary 
randomly between customers are subject to the fairness effect as some customers feel dis-
criminated against due to paying a higher price. This latter effect plagued Amazon in 2005 
when customers uncovered price experimentation and discrimination at their website.16 
Customers may not only expect that the price represents a sharing of the surplus benefi ts 
between the fi rm and the customer, but also expect that prices are fair in the sense that all 
customers are presented with the same options. When prices are out of line with these ex-
pectations, customers can call foul. Violating the concept of fairness may not only dampen 
immediate purchases, but it may spark customer outrage, leading to public relations crises. 
In these cases, marketing communication and public relations must be used to manage 
price variances that are perceived as unfair, and pricing practices may need to change.
The issue of fairness is not applied to all products equally. Fairness has a larger role in 
necessity goods than those related to discretionary purchases. Moreover, fairness issues are 
culturally dependent and can become the basis for ethical and legal challenges. 
OVERCONFIDENCE OF CONTROL OVER FUTURE BEHAVIOR
Customers purchase many products with the expectation of modifying their behavior in 
conjunction with the use of the product. Unfortunately, human beings systematically over-
estimate their ability to modify their own behavior in a positive manner. For anecdotal 
evidence, just consider the number of slightly used exercise machines available in online 
peer-to-peer sales networks like eBay or Craigslist. 
A signifi cant revelation of the misalignment between expected behavioral modifi cations 
and actual behavior expressed was found in a study of customers at gyms. Researchers 
reviewed over 7,000 purchases in which customers were able to select their membership 
level from a menu of contracts in three U.S. health clubs.17 It was found that members 
who chose a monthly subscription priced at $70 attended the gym on average 4.3 times 
per month, making a per-visit price of more than $17. These same members could have 
selected to pay $10 per visit using a 10-visit pass. Furthermore, customers who chose the 
monthly subscription were 17 percent more likely to stay enrolled past the fi rst year than 
those who purchased an annual subscription, which is surprising because monthly mem-
bers pay a higher fee for the privilege of canceling their contract at will. The inability of 
expressed behavior to match expected behavior was attributed to overconfi dence by the 
customers with respect to their future self-control and future economic effi ciency. 
SMALL-PIE BIAS 
Investigations into price negotiations have demonstrated that individuals suffer from a 
small-pie bias.18 Consistently, negotiators will underestimate the size of the bargaining 
zone; that is, they will believe they are negotiating between a very small range of possible 
price points rather than the entire range that is possible. It is as if customers believe that 
the fi rm’s costs are a large portion of the price they face, and fi rms believe that the value of 
their product is very close to the marginal costs. By implication, both customers and fi rms 
overestimate the share of the surplus that they capture in a transaction and fail to achieve 
the fullest possible surplus.
This effect is called the small-pie bias because both parties to a transaction believe they 
are making a decision regarding the size of the slice they will gain from a small pie, rather 
than understanding that the pie may be quite large, allowing for a much better deal. 
To overcome the small-pie bias, researchers have suggested that sellers should formu-
late expectations of buyers’ reservation price and then use conversations in the negotiation 
itself to seek disconfi rming information that updates their beliefs of buyers’ reservation 
price. The disconfi rming information can be elicited by making initial offers that are out-
side of their expected buyer reservation price. In other words, start the opening bid at a

level well above what the seller expects the buyer to accept and then allow the negotiation 
process to bring it back to the transaction range. 
The need to overcome the small-pie bias is one of the reasons behind the earlier sug-
gestion to initiate price negotiations with customers aggressively and provide concessions 
reluctantly. This generalized prescription must be tempered when price negotiations are 
not the sole purpose of the initial offer, such as when initial offers are solicited by buyers 
to screen sellers according to price expectations.
PROMOTIONAL INFLUENCE 
Marketing promotions infl uence price sensitivity directly through the claims that they 
make and indirectly though the kind of customers who respond to promotions.19 In other 
words, what the fi rm says about its products, and to whom it says it, strongly infl uences 
its ability to capture prices that refl ect the value that it is delivering to customers. If a fi rm 
fails to communicate the value that it delivers to customers, the fi rm will fi nd the task of 
capturing a decent price diffi cult. Alternatively, if it communicates the value that it deliv-
ers to customers, it at least has a fi ghting chance to capture a decent price. Furthermore, 
if the fi rm spends its communication resources on customers who have little value for its 
offering or are otherwise highly price-sensitive, it will have a diffi cult time capturing a 
decent price. Alternatively, if the fi rm focuses its communications resources on customers 
who are relatively less price-sensitive, it will improve its ability to capture a good price. 
These claims have been based not only on the experiences of many business-to-business 
salespeople, but also on research on consumer goods.
In comparing the effects of price-oriented communications versus benefi t-oriented com-
munications for consumer goods, it has been found that the message communicated in 
sales claims or marketing communications has a strong effect on price sensitivity. Price-
oriented communications are those which identify a product or national brand with a 
price, usually a discounted price. Price-oriented communications are common within 
weekly store circulars, newspaper advertisements, and Internet promotional efforts and 
tend to be fi nanced by both the local retail outlet and the original manufacturer. Benefi t-
oriented promotions are those that focus on the brand and the features or benefi ts of the 
product. Benefi t-oriented promotions are commonly found in national advertising efforts 
such as television commercials and magazine advertisements and tend to be fi nanced by 
the original manufacturer alone. While price-oriented promotions are designed to com-
municate the availability of a product at a particular outlet, their emphasis on price can 
lead to heightened price sensitivity. In contrast, benefi t-oriented promotions tend to lead 
toward greater sensitivity to variations in benefi ts and concurrently lower price sensitivity. 
A secondary effect of promotions on price sensitivity arises from the ability of adver-
tising to increase the size of the addressable market. In consumer markets, customers
attracted by advertising behave differently with respect to prices than those customers 
who are less infl uenced by advertising. Specifi cally, advertising-sensitive consumers tend 
to be more price-sensitive consumers. By bringing new customers into the market who are 
more price-sensitive than the market overall, advertising has an indirect effect of increas-
ing the overall price sensitivity of the market.
Prospect Theory
An approach to encapsulating many of the psychological infl uences into a unifi ed theory 
has led to the development of prospect theory, codifi ed in a seminal paper by Khanamen 
and Tversky in 1979. 20 Many of the psychological effects explored later in this chapter can 
be described through prospect theory. Anchoring, the comparison set effect, the endow-
ment effect, the end-benefi t effect, order biases, and reference price effects are all, at least

somewhat, related to prospect theory. As such, prospect theory is an important framework 
for understanding many psychological infl uences to price perceptions. 
In construction, prospect theory examines how people make choices between prospec-
tive offers with risky outcomes. Because every purchase decision involves risk, prospect 
theory provides insightful explanations into customer behaviors and strong prescriptions 
for price management. 
LOSSES WEIGH HEAVIER THAN GAINS
One of the key insights elucidated through prospect theory is that losses weigh heavier 
than gains in decision making. While paying for a product in itself represents a loss, other 
forms of losses might include paying a higher price than expected or receiving fewer ben-
efi ts than expected. Likewise, the benefi ts delivered through a product represent a gain. 
Other forms of gain might include paying a lower price than expected or receiving more 
benefi ts than expected.
When making purchase decisions, customers tend to be more fearful of potentially 
losing through the transaction than they are happy about potentially gaining through the 
transaction. Colloquially, we can say that taking $10 away from a person causes more 
pain than giving that same person $10 causes joy. Thus, it can be conjectured that $10 in 
price paid weighs heavier in people’s minds than $10 in benefi ts gained. Some research 
has even uncovered that losses weigh about two-and-a-half times heavier in decision mak-
ing than gains. That is, for every $1 loss in price paid, the product may need to provide 
roughly $2.50 in benefi ts to leave customers emotionally neutral.
The effect of losses weighing heavier in people’s minds than gains implies that promo-
tional statements should heavily stress the benefi ts of the product over its price. By stress-
ing the benefi ts, sales claims and marketing communications can help customers become 
more aware of the potential to gain through the transaction. Moreover, these claims must 
be suffi cient to leave customers better off not only economically, but also in terms of the 
way in which they weigh benefi ts against costs. The goal of these promotional messages is 
to leave customers psychologically in a net-positive position.
INFLECTION AT THE POINT OF REFERENCE 
In making any purchase, customers will compare offers against their point of reference. 
This point of reference may be their current level of satisfaction with their current endow-
ment of products and wealth, the most recent prices seen in the market, or their most 
recent status prior to fi nding a product has expired and needs replacement. The point of 
reference can be thought of as the perceived status quo.
The fact that losses weigh heavier than gains in decision making implies that changes 
in status away from the point of reference will be evaluated differently. Losses away from 
the point of reference will be strongly avoided. Meanwhile, gains above the point of refer-
ence will be highly discounted. Combined, these effects lead towards a status quo bias, or 
tendency for customers to replace items with replicas of the last item purchased and avoid 
taking risks with new products and services.
DIMINISHING SENSITIVITY
As gains or losses increase away from the point of reference, people become less sensitive 
to the absolute magnitude of these gains or losses. That is, the difference between a $5 
gain and a $10 gain is felt more strongly than the difference between a $490 gain and 
a $495 gain, even though the absolute value of these differences is the same $5 in both 
cases. Similar differences can be found in the way losses are felt. In general, people express 
diminishing sensitivity as losses or gains mount.

RISK AVERSION IN THE POSITIVE FRAME AND RISK SEEKING 
IN THE NEGATIVE FRAME
Another insight elucidated in prospect theory is the tendency towards risk aversion in the 
positive frame and risk seeking in the negative frame. Positive frame offers imply that a 
person will, in some sense, gain from the transaction. Negative frame proposals imply that 
the person will, in some sense, lose from the transaction. 
Two offers made in the positive frame might be the 50 percent chance to gain $5,000 
versus the sure gain of $2,000. When offers are presented in the positive frame, many 
people will choose the less risky proposal of a sure gain of $2,000 even though the 50 per-
cent chance at gaining $5,000 has a greater net expected value. 
Two offers made in the negative frame might be a sure loss of $2,000 versus a 50 percent 
chance of a $5,000 loss. When offers are presented in the negative frame, a higher propor-
tion of people will choose the risky proposal of the 50 percent chance of a $5,000 loss over 
the sure loss of $2,000, even though the sure loss of $2,000 leaves the person better off than 
they should expect to be when taking the 50 percent chance at a $5,000 loss.
UTILITY FUNCTION FROM PROSPECT THEORY
The many insights into the mental calculus of customers have led to the development of an 
alternative utility function for describing purchase decisions. Rather than assuming that 
gains are traded off equally with losses, the utility function from prospect theory incorpo-
rates the decision biases of people when confronted with alternative offers. In Exhibit 5-2, 
the horizontal axis represents the actual loss or gain incurred in an offer, while the vertical 
axis represents the perceived value of that gain or loss within a person. The utility function 
plots the way losses and gains are perceived. 
The fact that losses weigh heavier than gains is captured in this graph. Points A and B 
represent an equal magnitude of an actual gain or loss, respectively (the horizontal axis). 
In terms of perceived value (the vertical axis), point A is closer to the origin than point B. 
Thus, the utility function shows that a gain of equal magnitude to a loss has a smaller 
weight in decision making. Furthermore, the utility function demonstrates diminishing 
sensitivity as gains and losses mount, and an infl ection at the point of reference.
PRESCRIPTIONS
Executives can use the insights gained from prospect theory in pricing. While the implica-
tions are far-reaching, three quick examples will suffi ce in demonstrating the power of 
prospect theory in providing prescriptions for better pricing.

One prescription from prospect theory is to unbundle gains and bundle losses. As noted, 
losses weigh heavier than gains and both losses and gains are felt with diminishing sensitiv-
ity as one moves away from the point of reference. As such, unbundling gains into multiple 
smaller gains encourages the customer to perceive a greater gain than otherwise would be 
felt. In contrast, bundling all the losses into a singular event, the payment of the item, de-
creases the perceived pain involved in the transaction. In transactions, the unbundling gains 
and bundling losses can be executed by itemizing all the sources of benefi ts to heighten the 
sense of gain while providing only a single, total price into which to bundle the pain.
A second prescription from prospect theory is to avoid surcharges and provide dis-
counts. Surcharges are perceived as a punitive loss, while discounts are perceived as a gain. 
To encourage customers to pay a higher price, the higher price should not be posed as a 
surcharge, but rather the “regular” price. Any discounts are perceived as an additional 
gain on top of gaining the product. Thus, credit card fi rms would strongly prefer that mer-
chants raise prices and offer a 3 percent cash discount over implementing an equivalent 
credit card surcharge. Financially, these two offers can leave customers equally well off; 
however, surcharges are more likely to dissuade customers from using credit cards than 
the cash discounts.
The third prescription from prospect theory is to shift the pain from direct price paid 
to indirect opportunity costs. Many people associate less pain with loss of time and con-
venience than they do with direct and observable price payments. Shifting costs from the 
fi rm to customers by making them drive further for shopping, endure longer lines, or as-
semble their own products encourages purchases and lowers the perceived pain involved 
in the transaction. This third prescription may account for much of the success of super-
stores such as Wal-Mart, Tesco, and Carrefour, the furniture retailer IKEA, and discount 
airlines such as Ryanair.
Eﬀ ects Related to Prospect Theory
Prospect theory encapsulates many infl uences on customer perceptions of prices and
offers. Many of these infl uences were identifi ed before prospect theory was codifi ed and 
were studied in greater detail than can be described directly through prospect theory. 
What follows are some of the better understood effects that are related to prospect 
theory.
REFERENCE PRICE EFFECTS 
Prospect theory identifi ed the heightened sensitivity that people have in relation to their 
point of reference. One direct consequence of this is the reference price effect. In many 
markets, customers refer to the last price they paid in forming expectations regarding the 
price that they are willing to pay during the next purchasing situation. The manner in 
which past prices affect the perception of current prices is known as the reference price 
effect.21 
The reference price held by customers is informed by the price that they currently see 
on a product and the price that they last saw on the product. Mathematically, we can write 
this as
Reference Price 5 a (Last Observed Price) 
 
 
1 (1 2 a) (Currently Observed Price) 
Eq. 5.1
where the moderating factor a (pronounced “alpha”) describes the level of infl uence that 
past observed prices have on the current reference price. A large a implies that past prices 
largely determine the reference price that customers hold with respect to a product, while

a small a implies that currently observed prices largely determine consumer reference 
prices. The size of a is itself infl uenced by many factors, such as the frequency of purchase 
within the category and the importance of price in making purchase decisions within the 
category.22
An example of the reference price effect can be found in the market for beef steaks. 
In 2008, the price of corn doubled in one year, driving an increase in the price of beef. 
Customers visiting restaurants infrequently were often shocked to see a sudden jump in 
the price of steaks in comparison to the price that they last saw in the market. This can be 
considered as a form of the reference price effect, and as a type of an anchoring effect. Cus-
tomers expected one price and had a diffi cult time adjusting to new information regarding 
price levels. The result was a dampening of demand.
A traditional assumption concerning how prices infl uence buyers’ purchasing behaviors 
has been that buyers know the prices of the products and services that they consider for 
purchase. However, empirical research during the past four decade repeatedly has revealed 
that buyers are routinely unable to remember the prices of items that they have recently 
purchased. Even though consumers don’t have perfect recall of past observed prices, what 
recall they do have infl uences their willingness to pay, or the reference price.
When current prices are higher than past prices, the reference price effect drives an ex-
cess dampening in demand as current prices are above many consumers’ willingness to pay. 
Price increases due to infl ation or other economic factors are common, and the reference 
price effect predicts that demand will decline disproportionately as prices rise due to the 
need for customers to adjust their expectations to the new, higher price point.
A more insidious and common challenge for pricing professionals arising from the ref-
erence price effect comes from the use of promotional prices and discounts. During a price 
promotion, prices are lower than in the past, causing the reference price to be higher than 
the observed price. Thus, during the price promotion, sales will increase disproportion-
ately. After the price promotion, however, prices will be higher than those observed dur-
ing the last transaction. This drives their reference price to be higher than then observed 
prices during the non-sale period, thus dampening sales disproportionately. Consequently, 
during periods of price promotions, sales will sharply increase, and during regular price 
periods, sales will plummet. These dynamics may lead executives to believe that they must 
lower their prices to improve profi ts, when actually they simply indicate that they have 
been overly relying on price promotions to attract customers. The reference price effect is 
one of many reasons pricing professionals must go beyond purely quantitative analysis in 
managing price.
ENDOWMENT EFFECT
An intriguing psychological effect that can decrease price sensitivity is the endowment 
effect. 23 According to the endowment effect, people place more value in something once 
they possess it than they otherwise would. The endowment effect is strongly related in the 
heightened sensitivity uncovered around the point of reference in prospect theory.
The endowment effect was observed from experiments in which students were given 
coffee mugs and chocolate bars randomly and then allowed to make trades to optimize 
their gift. In the absence of any switching costs, it would be expected that about half of the 
students would switch products. Half of the coffee mug holders would prefer chocolate 
bars and vice versa, leading to half of the students trading gifts. However, experiments re-
peatedly show switching rates much lower than 50 percent. If the researcher asks students 
why they don’t switch, they reply that they really like what they got. The claimed love of 
their randomly distributed gift has been attributed to the endowment effect.
The endowment effect is used in sales situations by many fi rms. At bazaars, for instance, 
vendors will quickly put a product in the hands of prospects to lower their price sensitivity.

Similarly, automobile dealers will encourage customers to take a test drive to increase their 
likelihood of purchase. Even trial offers benefi t from the endowment effect by encouraging 
customers to adapt the new product once it has entered their endowment.
ANCHORING 
Signifi cant research into decision making has demonstrated that people create expecta-
tions based upon information gathered early in the decision-making process. Once a per-
son has created an expectation from an initial set of information, changing the person’s 
expectations will be diffi cult because it involves relearning or revealing new evidence that 
demonstrates the fallacy of applying expectations formed earlier to the current situation. 
The process of setting expectations early and changing them slowly is known as anchor-
ing. Anchoring not only affects perceptions of prices as high or low but also affects percep-
tions of benefi ts as necessary or superfl uous.
Examples of anchoring are very common in infrequently purchased, high-value busi-
ness markets. Offers coming early in a purchase decision process are likely to set expec-
tations for comparison to offers that are made later in the purchasing decision process. 
Prospects will anchor not just on the price of the offering, but also on the features, ben-
efi ts, and value that they expect from buying from that category. Because of the power of
anchoring to infl uence purchase decisions, many fi rms will hunt actively for prospects 
early in the purchase decision process and may even choose to ignore sales opportunities 
that come late in the purchase decision process.
Another example of anchoring can be found in negotiations. As any person who has 
experienced a few negotiations will tell you, people tend to anchor price expectations 
based on the fi rst price they hear. This is the primary role of anchoring in pricing. Cus-
tomers set their reservation price, or willingness to pay, early in the purchase decision 
process. Thus, beginning price conversations at higher levels tends to end price negotia-
tions at higher prices than those which began at a lower level.
In price negotiations with an unprepared buyer, anchoring can be used by a seller to 
drive prices higher so long as the buyer perceives the value to be above the price commu-
nicated early in the process. Some sales literature even suggests that during a negotiation, 
salespeople should elicit the customer’s acceptable purchase price fi rst as a means to reveal 
the customer’s willingness to pay. With more capable buyers, however, the anchoring effect 
of buyers around their willingness to pay is usually dissipated though structured learning 
and experience. In such cases, asking customers for their purchase price fi rst can actually 
harm the potential to achieve higher prices by anchoring the salesperson around his or her 
own minimum asking price.
Anchoring creates a challenge for business markets with respect to budgetary prices. 
Budgetary prices are not actual transaction prices, but rather price ranges given to custom-
ers early in the sales process to determine their ability to purchase as well as the magnitude 
of the decision-making impact. From a sales perspective, the need to provide budgetary 
prices is related to the need to qualify customers early in the sales process with regard to 
their ability to purchase, timing of purchase, and scope of purchasing needs. In giving bud-
getary prices, many sales instructions will tell salespeople to give a wide range of potential 
prices and clarify that the actual price will depend on the specifi c product selected. They 
may furthermore suggest using higher fi gures than expected in the fi nal price of the product. 
The logic behind this prescriptive suggestion is related to the challenge that anchoring 
creates, both in reducing the ability to charge a higher price and in driving a potential 
offer outside the consideration set. Giving prospects a higher price is suggested to anchor 
prospective customers towards higher price expectations, thus weakening their resolve in 
later price negotiations. The use of a wide range of prices is called for to keep the sale from 
being blocked by a failure to meet the relevant competitors in the sales process.

Chapter 5 
Psychological Influences on Price Sensitivity
Anchoring may be related to aspects of prospect theory. Once people anchor on an 
 initial piece of information, it forms a reference point. Moreover, the gains that they would 
receive by updating that information may be perceived to be too few in relation to the costs 
required to change their perceptions. As such, anchors once placed are hard to displace.
COMPARISON SET EFFECT
Just as initial offers will infl uence price expectations through anchoring, the price of com-
parable alternatives will also infl uence price expectations. 24 The product plus its com-
parable alternatives under consideration in a specifi c purchasing opportunity form a 
comparison set. When some of the products within the comparison set are priced low, 
price expectations of customers will tend to decrease. When some of the products in the 
comparison set are priced high, price expectations of customers will tend to increase. 
Executives may be able to use the comparison set effect to infl uence price expectations. 
If the comparison set can be adjusted to include higher-priced items, customer price sen-
sitivity can be reduced. For instance, when marketing a small car aimed at fi rst-time car 
buyers in developing nations, automakers may fi nd that their sales increase and prices get 
stronger when comparing the price of the small car to that of a larger, more expensive 
car rather than the price of a motorcycle, even though the small car has been developed 
and marketed specifi cally for families who would have purchased the motorcycle had the 
inexpensive car not become available.
The comparison set effect can also be used with the benefi ts under consideration to shift 
the dimensions of competition in a fi rm’s favor. For instance, when customers are com-
paring durable goods, they may be tempted to compare only the upfront acquisition costs. 
Firms that offer products of higher quality, as measured by durability, effi ciency, or produc-
tivity, should include these dimensions when encouraging customers to evaluate the merits 
of competing offers. By shifting the metrics of comparison, they may be able to capture both 
a higher price and more sales. In contrast, fi rms that offer an inferior product at a lower 
acquisition price would want to encourage customers to focus on the initial price only.
FRAMING EFFECT
How an offer is framed can affect the willingness of customers to accept that offer. In
pricing, the framing effect can have dramatic infl uence on the price that customers are 
willing to pay. 
A common example of the framing effect can be found in a behavioral experiment
regarding the interaction between a person at the beach and a friend going to purchase 
beverages. The friend asks, “How much are you willing to pay for the drink? I will pay 
up to the amount you give me, but if the price is higher than that, I will not buy it.” Using 
one frame, the friend then concludes the proposition by saying, “I am going to the pristine 
hotel bar.” Using an alternative frame, the friend then concludes the proposition by saying, 
“I am going to a grungy convenience store.” People regularly state a higher willingness to 
pay if it is associated with a hotel rather than a convenience store, even though the beverage 
is exactly the same and the benefi ts gained are exactly the same. Depending on the frame 
through which the offer is made (pristine hotel bar versus grungy convenience store), the 
person on the beach will change his or her willingness to pay. 
The framing effect is related to many aspects of prospect theory. For instance, framing 
an offer in the positive frame will naturally make it more attractive than framing the same 
offer in the negative frame. Thus, rather than highlighting the price and the costs associ-
ated with using a product, fi rms are usually better off highlighting the benefi ts and the 
value derived from a product. Moreover, rather than lumping all the positive elements of 
an offer into a common frame, customers are usually more willing to purchase a product 
when all the positive elements of the offer are disaggregated and itemized.

ORDER BIAS
Pricing research has shown that the order of presentation of prices affects the selection of 
products and acceptable prices by customers.25 Researchers have compared the dependence 
of the average transaction price on the order of price presentation. In general, when products 
are presented in decreasing price order (that is, from highest to lowest), customers select a 
higher price offer than when products are presented in increasing price order (that is, from 
lowest to highest). The order bias has been experimentally demonstrated with fast-moving 
consumer goods but remains suspect with more-expensive items and durable goods.
The order bias can be considered to be a result of anchoring upon initial offers and 
loss aversion coupled with a failure to adjust the frame of reference fully. When custom-
ers review a list of products in terms of both benefi ts and price, they may anchor their 
expectations of acceptable prices and benefi ts on the fi rst item considered. When that fi rst 
item delivers many benefi ts and is priced at a high level, they may be reluctant to forgo 
benefi ts to save a little by buying a lower-priced option. Hence they will tend to purchase 
a higher-priced item. In contrast, when the fi rst item is priced very low and delivers some-
what fewer benefi ts, they may be reluctant to pay a higher price to gain a few benefi ts and 
thus will tend to purchase a lower-priced item.
The order bias infl uences sales and marketing communication efforts with respect to 
capturing better prices. When presenting a range of products within the same category,
executives will present the highest-priced good fi rst prior to exhausting all the possibilities 
by moving throughout the price points to lower levels. In selling automobiles, mattresses, 
and other consumer durables, it is common practice to show models starting from the most
expensive item and moving downward from there. Similarly, in designing websites, many 
executives will showcase their most expensive items prior to revealing their cheaper 
alternatives.
END-BENEFIT EFFECT
Customers purchase products not because of their intrinsic features, but because they 
believe that the product will enable them to accomplish a goal. Sometimes, these goals are 
only tangentially related to the specifi c attributes of the product. Products that contribute 
a higher portion of the end-benefi t sought by a customer are associated with lower price 
sensitivity than those that are ancillary to the end-benefi t sought. Executives that help cus-
tomers frame their products in relationship to the true desired end-benefi t fi nd their price 
sensitivity is somewhat reduced.26
For instance, families will tend to purchase entrance to an amusement park or museum 
not because of the benefi ts of riding a roller coaster or seeing a unique exhibit, but 
because of the hope they have in reconnecting with their family members during the event. 
Amusement park and museum executives therefore tend to position their offering as a 
means to create memorable family experiences to decrease price sensitivity and increase 
customer volume. 
Similarly, successful diet food manufacturers have repositioned their offerings into 
weight-loss management systems. Moreover, much of the promotional material from 
these fi rms have moved one step further, not only tying their offering to successful weight 
loss, but connecting it to higher-level aspirational goals such as looking better, feeling 
healthier, or commanding a positive impression at social functions. When fi rms facilitate 
the connection between their core offering and a customer’s aspirational goals, they can 
reduce price sensitivity.
The end-benefi t effect infl uences not only prices, but also promotional messages. In 
promoting a product, executives should stress the relationship between their customers’ 
goals and their products rather than simply focus on its features and attributes. In this 
sense, the end-benefi t effect is a direct extension of the prescription from prospect theory

to highlight gains and minimize losses. Framing a product as being a major contributor to 
the full end-benefi t desired can make customers less price-sensitive.
Summary
• Many psychological infl uences to the perception of value arise from neurological 
functions, decision biases, and behavioral effects. Price management requires an 
understanding of the psychological infl uences on value perception.
• Customers are less price-sensitive when they are spending other people’s money 
than when they are spending their own.
• Switching costs, both psychologically driven from brand devotion and fi scally 
driven from investments in complementary goods, business processes, or learning, 
can encourage customers to avoid changes from the status quo.
• Higher-expenditure product categories may be associated with greater price 
sensitivity as customers hold a strong economic incentive to compare offers by 
both price and benefi ts.
• By making price comparison diffi cult, fi rms can lower price sensitivity. The 
diffi cult comparison effect can be used by incumbents to halt the progress of new 
entrants, branded goods to halt the invasion of generics, and retailers to encourage 
customers to purchase a seemingly less expensive but actually more expensive 
item.
• The tendency for prices to end in 9 appeals to decision heuristics to pay attention 
only to the leftmost digit and uses cognitive accessibility challenges to discourage 
price comparisons when shopping. Price endings may also communicate a message, 
such as being priced cheaply or being lucky, depending upon culture infl uences.
• People expect fairness in transactions and can retaliate when their conception of 
fairness is breached. The fairness effect can dampen the ability of fi rms to increase 
prices, especially with necessity-oriented goods. 
• Customers regularly suffer from overconfi dence with respect to future behavior. 
Overly ambitious behavioral expectations can explain the tendency of customers to 
purchase packages greater than their needs.
• Both buyers and sellers routinely bias expectations to believe that they are 
negotiating over a smaller pie than they truly are. The small-pie bias leads to a 
tendency to accept smaller offers in sales situations. 
• The message used to promote a product infl uences the value perceived in the 
product. Price-oriented promotions increase price sensitivity, while benefi t-oriented 
promotions increase benefi t sensitivity, thereby supporting higher prices.
• Prospect theory attempts to encapsulate many of the psychological infl uences on 
the perception of value. From prospect theory, we see that losses weigh heavier 
than gains, that the point of reference strongly infl uences the perception of an 
offer, sensitivity diminishes as losses or gains mount, and that people tend to 
be risk-averse in the positive frame while risk-seeking in the negative frame. A 
number of prescriptions for executives can be derived from prospect theory, such as 
unbundling gains and bundling pains, avoiding surcharges and providing discounts 
instead, and shifting direct sources of pain into indirect, less transparent pains.
• Reference prices are moderated by both the currently observed prices and the last 
observed prices. Price increases will yield prices above the reference price level, thus 
aggravating a drop in demand. Price decrease will yield prices below the reference 
price level, thus further stimulating a growth in demand.

• The endowment effect is the tendency of people to place more value in something 
once they possess it than they otherwise would. The endowment effect explains the 
ability to decrease price sensitivity and increase purchase rates simply by asking 
prospective customers to hold a product while making decisions. 
• People have a tendency to anchor upon information gained early in the decision-
making process. Anchoring can be used in selling situations to encourage customers 
to expect a higher price than what is fi nally determined, or can be overcome by 
salespeople by seeking disconfi rming evidence during interactions and negotiations 
with clients. 
• Customers formulate price expectations based upon the alternatives under 
consideration, or the comparison set. Lower-priced alternatives tend to 
heighten price sensitivity, and higher-priced alternatives tend to lower price 
sensitivity.
• The frame through which customers evaluate an offer affects their willingness 
to pay. Providing reasons to expect a higher price leads to less price sensitivity. 
Providing reasons to expect a lower price leads to greater price sensitivity.
• The order of offers can affect the average transaction price. Presenting a product 
lineup from the highest price down can bias selection towards higher-priced goods. 
Likewise, presenting the product lineup from the lowest price up can bias selection 
towards lower-priced goods. 
• The greater portion that a product contributes towards the end-benefi t sought 
by a customer, the lower price sensitivity customers will have with respect to that 
product.
Exercises
 1. A study indicated that the optimal price for a consumer product is $32.45. Most 
products in the market sell for $29.99. What price would you suggest to retailers 
for selling the product, and why?
 2. A haute cuisine restaurant is opening down the street, and its owner asks you for 
advice on pricing. Should you suggest that the restaurant price an appetizer at 
$6.99 or $7, and why?
 3. The haute cuisine restaurateur has many appetizers in the range of $6 to $12 and 
many entrees in the range of $15 to $30. The chef has created a new vegetarian 
course and wishes to place it on the menu. Because the food costs are low on this 
dish, the restaurateur believes the proper price is $12, even though the course could 
be the main meal for the evening. On what part of the menu would you suggest 
placing the item and why?
 4. Consider a grocer that offers double coupon redemptions and you are thinking 
about purchasing oatmeal with a $0.25 coupon. Now consider a furniture store 
that is offering a $0.50 discount on a dining room set. In which case are you more 
likely to travel to that specifi c store to receive the discount? Do you believe your 
response is rational? Explain.
 5. A salesperson interacting with a corporate prospect believes she understands the 
challenge that the client is trying to address and quotes a project for $20,000 as 
a solution. A few days later, the corporate prospect begins to discuss many other 
aspects of the challenge that he is trying to address and asks for a proposal to be 
delivered. What is the nature of the pricing challenge that this salesperson has 
created, and how could she have prevented it?

• What is price segmentation?
• When does price segmentation work?
• Is price segmentation good or bad?
• How do segmentation hedges enable a fi rm to price-segment the market?
• How should an executive design a price segmentation policy?
• Stretch Question: If a fi rm price-segments the market, what is the optimal set of 
prices and market shares for the different price segments?
W
hile the best pricing techniques all share a foundation in guiding executives to 
price in proportion to value, they also share an opportunity, in that value is in 
the mind of the beholder and different minds will value a product differently. 
To seize this opportunity, fi rms will price-segment the market. Price segmentation is the 
method of pricing the same or similar products differently for different customer segments. 
Within any market, different customers will value products differently, and therefore 
they will be willing to pay different amounts for that product. The diversity of individual 
customers within the collective market is a form of heterogeneity. Market heterogeneity 
can be seen in terms of brand affi nity, benefi ts demanded, or willingness to pay. When we 
are describing differences between individuals in their willingness to pay, we are describing 
a form of heterogeneity in demand.
A simple thought experiment will demonstrate that almost every conceivable market ex-
hibits heterogeneity in demand. Let us consider a market where every customer purchased 
only one unit.1 The expressed demand at any given price is the number of customers who 
are willing to pay any price up to the one required. If the market was homogeneous and 
all customers had the exact same willingness to pay, the elasticity of demand would be

zero until that critical price is reached. That is, the number of units sold would be constant 
with respect to price changes until the critical price is reached. At the critical price, the 
elasticity of demand would stretch to infi nity as demand collapsed to zero. Overall market 
demand curves that are fl at until a critical price is reached and then drop to zero at that 
critical price have not been reported in any markets to date. Therefore, we can conclude 
that heterogeneity in demand is the overwhelming norm for markets.
The drivers to heterogeneity in demand are multifarious. Some customers may derive 
greater benefi ts from the product compared to others with more modest requirements, and 
therefore they are willing to pay more. Some customers may have higher incomes, thus 
enabling them to pay more. Alternatively, some customers may have more time to price-
compare and are therefore more price-sensitive. As we will uncover, even more issues may 
drive demand heterogeneity. The point is, demand is heterogeneous and this heterogeneity 
in demand creates the opportunity to practice price segmentation.2 
Price segmentation, also known as price discrimination in economics, is charging
different customers different prices for an otherwise identical or similar product. Firms can 
practice price segmentation by aligning prices to demand heterogeneity in an effort to extract 
a greater portion of the consumer surplus from the market in the form of profi ts. Factors that 
drive (or undermine) value for customers can be used to create a price segmentation policy in 
that the fi rm automatically charges more (or less) when and where the product delivers more 
(or less) utility. Alternatively, fi rms can practice price segmentation by aligning prices to cost 
factors to discourage profi t-destructive behaviors. Factors that drive the cost to serve can be 
used to charge more automatically when there are predictably higher incremental costs for 
the seller. In either case, price segmentation enables the fi rm to increase profi ts. 
A signifi cant hindrance to price segmentation is the potential for aftermarket transference. 
Products priced with segmentation policies need to have limited transferability—that is, once 
sold to a customer, that customer should fi nd it diffi cult to resell it to another customer. If the 
product is easily transferable, then customers in the lower-priced segment are able to purchase 
the product and subsequently resell it to the higher-priced segment to their own advantage 
and not the fi rm’s, and therefore price segmentation will fail to improve supplier profi ts. In 
the absence of limited transferability, price segmentation creates aftermarket trading alterna-
tively named parallel or gray markets. Aftermarket trading remains a signifi cant challenge for 
many products. Fungible products from tangible cigarettes and alcohol to intangible software 
and digital entertainment are all subject to aftermarket trading among consumers. 
It is hard to discuss price segmentation without raising ethical and potentially legal
issues.3 However, pricing professionals need to be able to explore this area dispassionately 
if they are to be effective in their work. Price segmentation is a powerful tool for driving 
profi ts. It is practiced in many markets, cultures, and jurisdictions with neither popular 
indignation nor legal recourse. Indeed, governments themselves commonly practice price 
discrimination.4 In fact, price segmentation can actually be benefi cial to consumers in 
cases where the practice of price segmentation allows for a product to be sold to customers 
who otherwise would fi nd the product unattainable. While we will examine ethical and 
legal issues of pricing in Chapter 17, for now we will take a more pragmatic viewpoint and 
address the issues of why and how.
Value of Price Segmentation
INCREASING PROFITS AND CUSTOMERS SERVED
Price segmentation enables two key developments within an industry. One, it can im-
prove the fi rm’s profi ts. Two, it can improve the number of customers served by actually 
l owering the market entry price for some customers. We can demonstrate these claims 
with a simple graph. (See Appendix 6 for a mathematical defense of these claims.)

Chapter 6 
Price Segmentation
In the absence of price segmentation, the fi rm will attempt to optimize a single price 
against the market’s demand curve. Customers with a willingness to pay above the single 
price required will purchase, while those whose willingness to pay is below the single
price will not purchase. The fi rm will earn profi ts in proportion to the difference between 
the optimal price and their variable costs multiplied by the number of customers who are 
willing to purchase at that price. See Exhibit 6-1.
With two-segment pricing, price segmentation aggregates the market into two 
groups: one that pays a higher price and the other that pays a lower price. Thus, the 
fi rm will now earn profi ts from two sources. See Exhibit 6-2. For normal markets, 
the optimal higher price in a two-price segment strategy will be greater than that of a 
single-price strategy, so the fi rm will enjoy a higher contribution margin from some of 
its customers. Moreover, for normal markets, the optimal lower price in a two-price 
segment strategy will be less than the price determined in a single-price strategy, allow-
ing the fi rm to increase the units sold and expand its market. As such, price segmenta-
tion enables the fi rm both to increase its profi ts and increase the number of customers 
served. 
We can illustrate the same concepts using a quantitative example. Recall that in Chap-
ter 2, we explored the profi t dynamics for a product given an elasticity of demand of 
21.67 and overall demand of 368,000 units if priced at the $10 variable cost where the 
fi xed costs were assumed to be $1 million. For this example product, we found that profi t 
would be maximized at $200,000 per quarter at the optimal price of $25 and resulting 
volume of 80,000 units. 
If we ran a similar analysis for a product sold to the same market with the same over-
all demand and elasticity of demand but under the condition of perfect price segmenta-
tion with two prices, we would fi nd that the optimal high price is $47 and the optimal 
low price is $19.5 With a perfect segmentation hedge, 28,000 units would be sold at the 
higher price to customers willing to pay $47 or more; and 98,000 units would be sold 
at the lower price to customers willing to pay $19 or more, up to $47. The total units 
sold would become 126,000, a full 46,000 more than under single-price optimization, 
or 58 percent more units, implying that 58 percent more purchasing opportunities leave 
customers better off when the fi rm price-segments the market into two groups rather 
than one. The resulting profi t would be $918,000—360 percent higher profi ts with two 
price segments rather than one.

Price Segmentation

With a modicum of creative thinking, we can run the same analysis with three, four, or 
more prices under the same constraint of perfect price segmentation. Each time, we would 
fi nd that the market entry price, or the price at which customers with the lowest willing-
ness to pay will be charged, will decrease; and the premium price, or the price at which 
customers with the highest willingness to pay will be charged, will increase. With a lower 
market entry price, more units are sold and more customers or purchasing opportunities 
result in a transaction. Importantly, by improving the match between perceived value and 
price extracted, profi ts increase.
THE SEGMENTATION HEDGES KEY
The key to price segmentation is the ability to separate customers who are willing to 
pay more from those who are not. To accomplish this feat, fi rms construct segmentation 
hedges to segment the market according to willingness to pay. If the segmentation hedge is 
perfect, then all customers who are willing to pay a price greater than the higher price will 
purchase at that higher price, whereas any customer willing to pay more than the lower 
price but less than the higher price are allowed to purchase at the lower price. Importantly, 
a perfect segmentation hedge prevents any customer who is willing to pay more than the 
higher price to purchase at the lower price. 
Of course, segmentation hedges are not perfect except in idealized cases. However, price 
segmentation with even imperfect segmentation hedges can improve the fi rm’s profi ts and 
the number of customers served. Executives readily understand the value of executing 
price segmentation. It is an old, basic, freshman-level economic concept and forms the 
basis for many corporate, product, and pricing strategies. 
If the segmentation hedges are very poor, however, price segmentation can actually 
harm profi ts. An ineffective segmentation hedge would prevent customers who would be 
willing to pay the higher price from masquerading as customers who will pay only the 
lower price. Consequently, no products would be sold at the higher price, and all prod-
ucts would be sold at the lower price. As discussed, the optimal lower price in most price 
segmentation strategies is actually lower than the optimal price in a single-price strategy. 
Thus, with poor segmentation hedges, all customers, both those with a high willingness 
to pay and a low willingness to pay, will purchase at the same low price, a price that is

Price Segmentation
predicted to be lower than that optimal for the entire market, and the fi rm’s profi ts will 
have been reduced.
The implementation challenge of price segmentation is not in convincing manage-
ment of its ability to improve profi ts, but in determining the segmentation hedge. Un-
covering an acceptable and enforceable means to charge different customers different 
prices for an otherwise same or similar product is the fi rst challenge for any segmenta-
tion hedge. Ensuring that the segmentation hedge drives customers who are willing to 
pay more to actually pay more, rather than substitute into the lower-priced level, is the 
second challenge.
Price Segmentation Classiﬁ cations
While price segmentation is as old as trade itself, formal studies of price segmentation 
have been underway for only about a century. Shortly after the advent of economics, 
people have been making valiant attempts at itemizing and categorizing all the forms 
of price segmentation. A full listing of price segmentation techniques is unattainable
precisely because inventive business executives will devise new approaches and twists on 
old approaches to price segmentation inherently due to the profi t-making potential of 
improving the technique. However, there are three popular classifi cation strategies for 
price segmentation. 
FIRST-, SECOND-, AND THIRD-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION
In 1920, Arthur Cecil Pigou released his treatise on economics of welfare in which he
defi ned three types of price segmentation.6 Perfect price discrimination, or fi rst-degree 
price discrimination, is charging every customer at the price that matches their willingness 
to pay. In perfect price discrimination, all consumer surplus is captured by the producing 
fi rm. In practice, perfect price discrimination is impossible because it requires the seller to 
know exactly each customer’s willingness to pay. 
Second-degree price discrimination is charging different customers different prices
according to the quantity purchased. Classic, quantity-based second-degree discrimination 
implies that larger orders are available at a lower unit price than smaller orders. Second-
degree price discrimination, unlike perfect price discrimination, is common, although 
Pigou himself doubted its long-term effi cacy.
Third-degree price discrimination is charging different markets or market segments differ-
ent prices. An update to classic third-degree price discrimination has been to include benefi t-
based price segmentation in which products are designed to serve different market segments, 
where those with greater benefi ts cost a higher price than those with fewer benefi ts. 
COMPLETE, DIRECT, AND INDIRECT PRICE SEGMENTATION
The approach to defi ning price segmentation categories has since been updated from
Pigou’s ordinal system. An alternative practice is to classify price segmentation techniques 
according to the information required to execute them.7
Complete discrimination is used to defi ne pricing practices in which each purchase is 
made at a price wherein the marginal benefi ts to the customer equal the price charged, 
which is equivalent to fi rst-degree price discrimination. Complete price discrimination, as 
noted with fi rst-degree price discrimination, requires complete information of all custom-
ers’ willingness to pay in all situations, a feat that is likely to cost more to achieve than 
would be rewarded through profi t increases.
Direct segmentation defi nes price variances based upon specifi c attributes of the cus-
tomer, such as age, gender, or location. Direct segmentation is relatively easy to implement 
and is a common practice of public institutions, nonprofi ts, and for-profi t fi rms alike.

Indirect segmentation defi nes price variances based upon a proxy that correlates to 
customer segmentation based on willingness to pay. The proxy can be the use of coupons, 
package size, usage quantity, or any other variable that encourages price-sensitive custom-
ers to self-identify while discouraging customers who are willing to pay more from pur-
chasing at the lower price point. 
STRATEGIC OR TACTICAL PRICE SEGMENTATION
A third approach to defi ning price segmentation categories is simply to separate price 
segmentation practices that are tactical and short-term in nature from those that are 
strategic and longer-term.
Tactical price segmentation approaches are those that are used to capture marginal 
and sometimes even specifi c customers in unique situations. Tactical price segmenta-
tion techniques may form a part of the normal approach to business, but the decision 
to grant a tactical price variance is always grounded in the specifi cs of a situation. In 
consumer markets, coupons, price promotions, and rebates can all be said to be tactical 
approaches to price segmentation. In business markets, meet-the-competition pricing, 
volume discounts, and customer-specifi c price variances are also tactical price segmenta-
tion techniques. 
Strategic price segmentation approaches are those in which the defi nition of the price 
structure itself enables different customers to pay different prices. Multipart tariffs, com-
plement and add-on pricing, versioning, bundling, subscriptions, and yield pricing are all 
forms of strategic price segmentation. In some situations, even simple unit pricing can 
be considered a form of strategic price segmentation because it charges high-consuming 
 customers a higher total price than it charges low-consuming customers. 
Designing Segmentation Hedges
Segment hedges are barriers that prevent customers who are willing to pay a higher price 
from paying a lower price. If the segmentation hedge acts as a sieve rather than a bar-
rier, it can actually damage profi ts. While it is doubtful that any practical segmentation 
hedge can deliver perfect price segmentation, executives can often improve their current 
pricing policy by improving their segmentation hedges. The four requirements for ef-
fective segmentation hedges derive from its correlation with customers’ perception of 
value, the  information needed for its implementation, its enforceability, and its cultural 
acceptability.
The primary requirement for segmentation hedges is that they must sort customers or 
customer segments effi ciently according to their willingness to pay. 
Segmentation hedges that are highly correlated to customers’ willingness to pay are 
better than those that are weakly correlated to customers’ willingness to pay in improving 
the ability of the fi rm to profi t from a price segmentation strategy. Often, executives accept 
a convenient segmentation hedge that may or may not be well correlated with willingness 
to pay. Pricing executives will have a large impact if they can improve the relationship 
between the segmentation hedges and actual customer willingness to pay. Uncovering cus-
tomer metrics that are highly correlated to willingness to pay requires understanding the 
drivers of value within the market.
A related requirement for segment hedges is that they should require minimal infor-
mation gathering about specifi c customers on the part of the supplier to segment the 
market in an economically effi cient manner. It cannot be expected that at the point of 
transaction, each customer will provide a complete profi le of him- or herself to identify 
the price to be charged. Many segmentation hedges require only one piece of information

Price Segmentation
to group customers according to their willingness to pay. Some popular segmentation 
hedges elicit specifi c behaviors that reveal customers’ price sensitivity, effectively making 
the information-gathering effort invisible. Detailed customer profi les are constructed 
in only a few circumstances, mostly those related to industrial products or high-value 
 consumer products. 
From an operational standpoint, segmentation hedges also need to be enforceable, 
which usually results in constructing hedges with objective criteria. Managers need clear 
indicators of when a price variance should be granted and when prices should be kept 
high, leading to a need for clear, objective criteria for setting prices. Furthermore, price 
segmentation policies based on objective criteria are useful for discouraging potential 
abuse. Unscrupulous salespeople may abuse price segmentation policies to grant better 
prices to favored customers while making other customers pay higher prices regard-
less of their actual willingness to pay. Likewise, price segmentation policies provide
incentives for customers to masquerade as customers with a lower willingness to pay, 
regardless of their true propensity. Objective criteria both improve clarity in setting 
prices and thwart abuse in managing prices, leading to better enforceability of price 
segmentation policy.
Finally, from the viewpoint of corporate citizenry, consumer desirability, and public 
relations, segmentation hedges must be culturally acceptable—or at least not observably 
culturally repulsive. We cannot overlook the fact that price segmentation treats some 
customers differently than others, and it can appear unfair, unjust, and unethical (if not
illegal) to customers in the higher-paying category. There are price segmentation policies 
in practice that, if they were made aware to the public and regulators, would be scuttled 
quickly. Other price segmentation policies are considered to be culturally acceptable even 
though the true economics of the situation would imply an unfair, if not regressive, ap-
proach to pricing. In many cases, however, price segmentation policies are not only cultur-
ally acceptable and fully legal, but even desired by customers themselves. To navigate this 
labyrinth of potential social, cultural, and legal land mines, executives must calibrate and 
manage the acceptance of a segmentation hedge carefully. 
Common Price Segmentation Hedges
Price segmentation is highly common due to its potential to improve profi ts.8 We can fi nd 
examples of price segmentation in consumer and business markets as well as government-
supplied products and services. Organizations use price segmentation with services and 
goods, tangibles and intangibles, and durables and consumables. While we will explore 
tactical and strategic price segmentation in more detail in coming chapters, it is useful to 
review some simple examples of segmentation hedges in building a foundational under-
standing of price segmentation.
CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHICS/FIRMOGRAPHICS
Customer demographics, such as age, gender, and income, are often used for the develop-
ment of segmentation hedges. Customer demographics are objective and easy to iden-
tify criteria, hence they meet two of the requirements for forming a sound segmentation 
hedge. For some products, demographic information even correlates with willingness to 
pay. While price segmenting based on demographic information may at fi rst appear to be 
philosophically reprehensible, it is amazing how culturally acceptable the practice is. 
Similar to demographic segmentation used in consumer markets, fi rmographic price 
segmentation has been used in business markets. Like demographic segmentation, fi rmo-
graphic segmentation relies upon objective criteria such as location, industry, employment 
base, revenue base, and occasionally the company’s customer base.

Age
In accordance with the four design requirements, age can be a good segmentation hedge 
with many products. Consider senior citizen and children discounts. With senior citizen 
and children discounts, age is used as the segmentation hedge. 
Age is both an objective and easy-to-identify criteria based upon government-issued 
identifi cation (driver’s licenses and passports, for example). Moreover, both senior citizens 
and families with children are susceptible to having higher price sensitivity than other 
customer segments, though the underlying driver to their price sensitivity may be differ-
ent. Families with children often have budget constraints, leading them to more frugal 
behavior and higher price sensitivity. While some seniors are likewise constrained by their 
budgets, a signifi cant driver of their price sensitivity is the abundance of leisure time that 
retirees enjoy, which enables them to price-compare between offers. 
Regardless of the driver, the status of being a senior citizen or a child is correlated 
with price sensitivity in many product categories, and thus age meets the most critical 
requirement of segmentation hedges: it discriminates customers based on willingness to 
pay. Finally, framing has much to do with the cultural acceptability of age as a segmen-
tation hedge. Most cultures accept the concept of providing price discounts to seniors 
and children and even view fi rms that offer them as being more progressive and kind. In 
contrast, these same cultures would be outraged if the same pricing policy was reframed 
as a price surcharge for non-seniors or non-children. 
Gender
Ladies’ Night is a common practice at drinking establishments worldwide, including, until 
recently, the United States.9 During Ladies’ Night promotions, discounted entrance fees 
and drinks are provided to women to encourage more women to attend the entertainment 
venue and better balance the ratio of men to women. Although the correlation of willing-
ness to pay to gender for beverages and entertainment is dubious, it is hard to argue with 
the results. Ladies’ Night proved to be an effective promotional tool for many establish-
ments in driving traffi c and subsequent beverage sales. The loss of this promotional tool 
has caused much consternation by both establishment managers and many of their male 
and female customers. The practice of Ladies’ Night remains common in most nations. 
An alternative form of gender-based price segmentation that has yet to be dismissed 
is found at the local hair salon. A man and a woman who both want a haircut will often 
pay very different prices, even for the same short-haired style. The practice is defended 
on the grounds that women’s hairstyles require greater skill and time than men’s, even as 
this claim is becoming more dubious with the entry of the metrosexual male. In general, 
though, women continue to have a higher willingness to pay for beauty than men.
Comparing gender against the four design criteria, we fi nd that it is (1) objective, (2) easily 
identifi able in most cases, (3) somewhat correlated with willingness to pay in certain categories, 
and (4) questionably culturally accepted. As such, it can act as a segmentation hedge.
Income
Price segmentation on income is practiced by many nonprofi t institutions under the 
 umbrella of fi nancial aid. Colleges and universities will set high prices for tuition, but they 
provide fi nancial aid to select students. Financial income is often a determining factor in 
granting fi nancial aid. Presumably, students from a wealthy background have more fi nan-
cial resources to pay and therefore have a higher willingness to pay. Meanwhile, students 
from less well-to-do backgrounds, yet of high academic quality, require fi nancial aid to 
pay for the learning experience. By charging high tuition and selectively granting fi nancial 
aid, schools are in effect extracting prices from customers based on the value they place 
on going to that school.

Price Segmentation
TIME OF PURCHASE 
Time of purchase is an inherently objective criterion. In addition, it does not require any spe-
cifi c customer information, but rather it indirectly tracks customer behavior that is suspected 
to be correlated with willingness to pay. Matinee prices, lunch specials, early-bird discounts, 
and seasonal pricing are all examples of using time of purchase as a segmentation hedge. 
Matinee prices and early-bird discounts both exploit time of purchase as an indicator of 
leisure time. Customers viewing movies in the middle of the day or eating dinner prior to 
the end of a business day are likely not to be subject to the time constraints associated with 
employment. With greater leisure time, these customers can search for alternatives and seek 
the lowest price, thus warranting the need for a price concession to attract their business. 
Lunch specials are driven by a different consumer behavior than matinee prices and 
early-bird specials, however. Dinner crowds often seek an expanded set of benefi ts beyond 
that provided by tasty and nourishing food—they are also seeking an enjoyable restaurant 
experience. The dinner occasion is driven by the desire for entertainment, relaxation with 
one’s family and friends, or impressing one’s professional colleagues. In contrast, lunch 
crowds have fewer expectations of deriving enjoyment from dining. For some, their focus 
is solely on replenishing their energy prior to returning to work. Because dinner crowds 
seek and receive more benefi ts from the restaurant experience than lunch crowds, it can 
also be anticipated that dinner crowds have a higher willingness to pay than lunch crowds. 
Price segmentation in the form of lunch specials exploits the partial correlation between 
price sensitivity and time of purchase. 
Seasonal factors can also act as price segmentation. For instance, vacationers tend to be 
less price-sensitive because their shopping time interferes with their other desired vacation 
activities. As such, summer vacation locations often fi nd it benefi cial to raise prices during 
the summer season to capture profi ts from vacationers while reducing prices during “off-
season” to attract volume from the locals. Similarly, gift-giving seasons are not marked 
by the highest price sensitivity, but customers do have more price sensitivity during these 
times than during other times. We can see this in the common practice of having shallow 
pre-Christmas sales, followed by deeper post-holiday sales. 
Moreover, many of these time-based segmentation hedges exploit an opportunity of 
the supplier to time-shift price-sensitive customers to off-peak periods. Time-shifting cus-
tomers both increases the available supply during peak periods when less-price-sensitive 
customers arrive and improves capacity utilization during off-peak periods.
Matinee prices, lunch specials, and early-bird discounts are all framed as discounts 
from a higher “regular” price. Framing these price segments as discounts enables custom-
ers to perceive them as a new source of gain rather than the regular price as an unwanted 
higher form of pain; thus, they tend to be culturally acceptable. 
An alternative form of using time of purchase as a segmentation hedge is found in 
yield management and other dynamic pricing mechanisms. Yield management is most 
commonly found in airline ticket prices, though is also used with hotels, container ships, 
and other products. With yield management, prices increase depending upon the time of 
purchase in relationship to the time of use. The price increases as the time of purchase ap-
proaches the time of use. In this case, customers purchasing at times closer to the time of 
use are suspected to have greater urgency in terms of using the product, and therefore a 
higher willingness to pay. 
PURCHASE LOCATION
The same product can be priced at very different levels depending upon the location of 
the outlet. While some of the difference in price may be explained by cost-to-serve factors, 
much of the variation in prices between purchase locations is driven by pure heterogeneity 
in customer willingness to pay.

For example, consider a beverage purchased for consumption at the beach. Customers 
could bring their own beverages from home to the beach if they purchased them earlier 
at a grocery store. The customer could also purchase a beverage at a nearby convenience 
store on the way to the beach; or the customer could select a beach restaurant complete 
with service where beverages are brought to them by waitstaff. In each case, the price 
that these customers would expect to pay would vary greatly between the locations of 
purchase, even if the actual beverage consumed was identical. Much of this variation in 
price is correlated with differences in costs to serve, with grocery stores being the lowest-
cost channel and the dining area with the waitstaff representing the highest-cost channel. 
However, part of the variation in price is also correlated to willingness to pay and the 
benefi ts sought. The customer ordering a beverage from a server is seeking a large set of 
benefi ts (service plus beverage) and is expressing a higher willingness to pay than one who 
brought a beverage from home.
Variation in prices based on purchase location can be driven purely by heterogeneity 
in willingness to pay. For example, grocery stores may price the same or similar set of 
goods at different prices between locations based upon competitive factors and consumer 
behavior.10 Middle-class neighborhoods often have numerous grocery outlets serving cus-
tomers with ample access to transportation (cars), which enables them to price-compare 
between outlets. Customers from higher-income neighborhoods place more value on 
their leisure time, making them less prone to price comparison; thus, they have a margin-
ally increased willingness to pay. Meanwhile, customers in lower-income neighborhoods 
often suffer from lack of adequate transportation and less competition, enabling grocers 
to price products at a marginally higher level in lower-income neighborhoods than in 
higher-income ones. As such, grocery stores in middle-class neighborhoods often provide 
the lowest prices in comparison to those in either poorer or richer neighborhoods. While 
pricing products higher in higher-income neighborhoods is usually free from customer 
backlash, pricing products higher in lower-income neighborhoods is fraught with poten-
tial challenges.11 
BUYER SELF-IDENTIFICATION
Price segmentation policies may also rely upon buyer self-identifi cation of willingness to 
pay. Promotional sales, buyer’s clubs, coupons, and rebates are all forms of price segmen-
tation that rely upon buyer self-identifi cation.
Hunting for sales, cutting out coupons, and mailing in rebates are all time-intensive 
activities for customers. Customers who are willing to invest the time in these activities are 
revealing their willingness to search for alternatives and fi nd the lowest prices. Customers 
who forgo coupon clipping and similar activities are likewise revealing their willingness 
to pay full price to save on opportunity costs. Providing price-sensitive customers with 
access to lower prices through targeted discounts while leaving the majority of the market 
to purchase at the regular price can improve fi rm-level profi tability.
Similarly, buyer’s clubs create an effective price segmentation technique because they 
require customers to declare their price sensitivity outright through membership. Buyer’s 
clubs require shoppers to pay a fee for membership in exchange for receiving a discount 
on all their shopping at that outlet. The size of the membership fee is set such that a casual 
shopper would not receive any fi nancial benefi t from the buyer’s club, but the heavy shop-
per would experience signifi cant savings over the course of the membership. These savings 
are provided to encourage greater loyalty, yet they also signal price sensitivity. Buyers’ 
clubs can prove to be highly profi table price segmentation strategies in markets where 
high-purchasing customers generate a disproportionate amount of profi ts and customer 
loyalty is a signifi cant driver of customer profi tability.

Price Segmentation
PRODUCT-ENGINEERED
Segmentation hedges are often product-engineered, where some products deliver greater 
benefi ts than others and each product within the category is priced differently to refl ect 
its added value. Product-engineered price segmentation relies upon the addition and sub-
traction of specifi c features to defi ne the segmentation hedges. Customers seeking greater 
utility from a product within a particular category fi nd that specifi c features and attributes 
are missing from lower-priced alternatives, and they are thus encouraged to purchase a 
higher-priced product or bundle of products within the category. Meanwhile, customers 
with minimal utility requirements and lower willingness to pay are enabled to purchase a 
feature-deprived product at a lower price.
With product-engineered segmentation policy, profi t-seeking fi rms usually reap larger 
margins with higher-priced items than with lower-priced items. No profi t-seeking fi rm has 
an incentive to add one iota in marginal cost unless it can gain more than that iota in price 
or an equivalent volume boost. 
The logic behind the claim that higher-benefi t products should also have higher con-
tribution margins is rather straightforward. Higher-benefi t products usually cost more to 
produce. With each marginal increase in cost, the fi rm should at least seek to price the 
product at a price greater than or equal to the marginal increase in cost, or else improving 
the product reduces profi ts. At a higher price and with downward-sloping demand curves, 
the benefi t-rich product could be expected to attract fewer customers than a feature-
deprived product. Combined, these factors imply that the higher-priced product is likely 
both to increase marginal cost to produce and attract diminished customer demand. To 
compensate for these combined factors, the fi rm should seek to reap larger margins on 
higher-priced products than they seek on lower-priced products. 
There are times when increases in marginal costs for product improvements are 
matched with smaller increases in the marginal price. Competitive forces may drive a 
fi rm to increase features beyond the potential price increase. Likewise, some product 
improvements come without increases in marginal costs. Finally, some products require 
enhancements to attract a larger market, especially with newer product categories. In 
these cases, the diminished contribution margin should be compensated by increased unit 
volume sales.
The key challenge for constructing a product-engineered segmentation hedge is defi ning 
which features and benefi ts some customers are willing to pay more for, and which ones 
all customers demand. Those features that all customers expect of the product category 
must be included in the lower-priced product. Features which only a segment of the mar-
ket will value form strong elements for differentiating products and creating a product-
engineered segmentation strategy.
Add-on pricing strategies, versioning, and bundling are all forms of product-
engineered price segmentation in which the addition and subtraction of tangible fea-
tures create the segmentation hedges. Branding can also be considered as a form of 
product-engineered price segmentation, where brand-name products command a higher 
price than generic or store-brand products, even when both are produced by the same 
supplier.
QUANTITY PURCHASED
Quantity purchased, either in a single transaction or in multiple transactions, is also a 
common price segmentation hedge. Like other approaches to price segmentation, quantity 
purchased is objective and is based on easily identifi able information. Outside of a few 
very specifi c business markets, the practice of altering the price paid based on quantity 
purchased is highly accepted.12

Price Segmentation

Order Size
Customers ordering large quantities are often provided a discounted price in comparison 
to those purchasing smaller quantities. For example, bubble wrap used in packaging can 
be sold to individuals at package delivery outlets and to larger organizations direct from 
the manufacturer. Individual customers will usually pay a much higher price for bubble 
wrap than larger organizations, not only because of their choice of purchasing outlet 
but also because of the quantity that they purchase at one time. Customers buying large 
quantities have suffi cient incentives to price-compare between suppliers, which lowers 
their willingness to pay. Customers purchasing smaller quantities have less incentive to 
price-compare, and thus have a higher willingness to pay. In these cases, quantity pur-
chase is closely related to willingness to pay, making quantity-based segmentation hedges 
effective.
Frequent Purchases
Like purchase quantity, purchase frequency can be used as a means for price segmenta-
tion. As customers consume a product, their desire for an additional unit of product can 
decline in a predictable way, making them much less willing to purchase additional units 
than they were for the purchase of the fi rst unit. Price segmentation on the basis of pur-
chase frequency attempts to use the heterogeneity of demand within specifi c customers to 
improve profi tability marginally.
CUSTOMER USAGE
Price segmentation based on product usage relies on the heterogeneity of value that cus-
tomers place on a product in relation to their usage patterns. For instance, urban indi-
viduals with access to mass transit will drive a car sporadically and will have less need 
for that car than a suburban family that requires an automobile daily. Likewise, people 
entertaining business customers or dating partners may place a much higher value on an 
automobile than those who simply seek transportation to work. If automobiles could 
be priced separately based on lifestyle, automakers might fi nd a new source of profi ts in 
pricing the automobile based on the miles driven and the purpose of the trip. Of course, 
automakers cannot price a car based directly on lifestyle. Cars purchased in suburban 
markets can be transferred easily to more urban locations, and entertainment cars can also 
be used for work-related transport. Instead, automakers make different models optimized 
for different buying needs. However, similar pricing strategies based on actual customer 
usage patterns are executed by some fi rms. 
Tie-ins and Two-Part Tariffs 
One approach to pricing based on usage is to break the product into two constituent parts, 
a durable part and a consumable part, and price the two parts separately. The effect is 
named tie-in pricing at one end of the spectrum and a two-part tariff at the other end. In 
both cases, the purchase of the consumable part is related to the purchase of the durable 
part. (Tie-ins and two-part tariffs are explored specifi cally in Chapter 9.)
For example, a razor handle is valuable to customers only if they also have razor 
blades. Razor handles are somewhat durable, while razor blades are far more consum-
able, becoming dull after roughly a month of usage. Moreover, razor handles are usually 
designed to hold only a single manufacturer’s blade, making them non-interchangeable. 
Firms are able to price the razor handle differently than the blade. In a sense, the purchase 
of the handle gives permission to the customer to buy the blade because the blades have 
little other value without the handle. Therefore, the blade price can refl ect usage and the 
handle price can refl ect the willingness of the customer to participate in the market for 
blades.

Chapter 6 
Price Segmentation
The approach of pricing blades and handles separately in the razor market can be 
found in other markets. At one time, a copy machine maker would demand that all 
customers purchase their paper only from it. Such tie-in pricing has since been declared 
illegal in the United States, yet it demonstrates the potential for fi rms to price the 
durable part of a product separately from the consumable part. Utility fi rms, such as 
those providing natural gas and electricity, will bill customers a connection fee (alter-
natively named a metering fee or service charge), plus a consumption charge based on 
the amount of service consumed. As with razor handles and blades, the durable part 
is charged differently than the consumable part. Similarly, gaming fi rms will price the 
durable gaming console at one level, while the consumable gaming software is priced 
separately.
In tie-ins markets, the prices of the consumable versus durable parts are set based upon 
very different agendas. Because the durable part is used over many periods, and because 
customers are usually price-sensitive to initial purchase prices to participate in a new prod-
uct transaction, the durable part is often priced low to attract customers in tie-in markets. 
Meanwhile, in tie-in markets, the consumable part is priced high and forms the basis for 
most of, if not all, the profi t. Customers tend to be less price-sensitive to the consumable 
part of the transaction because they have purchased the durable part already and face 
switching costs if they seek an alternative. 
The amount of the profi t that can be shifted to the consumable part of the product is 
limited by anti-dumping regulations and by the anticipated consumer behavior as calcu-
lated in a customer lifetime value model. Customer lifetime value is highly dependent upon 
the frequency of repeat purchases and the duration of customer loyalty. We can see these
effects with mobile phone operators. Durable handsets are often subsidized by the mobile 
phone operator to encourage customers to select their services; meanwhile, all profi ts
are earned from the sale of connection time and data transfer. Only in a few markets 
where regulation prevents locking handsets with single mobile phone operators, such as in 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are handsets not subsidized by the revenues earned from 
phone calls and data transmissions. 
In contrast, in two-part tariff markets, the prices of the durable part of the offer are 
set very high to capture profi ts while prices of the consumable part of the offer are set 
low. The demands of customers are very different in two-part tariff markets than they 
are in tie-in markets. Specifi cally, customers will tend to be more sensitive to the price 
of the consumable part of the offer than they are to the price of the durable part. Utility 
bills for residential customers are often set in accordance with the concept of a two-part 
tariff. 
Enterprise Software Complexity Charges
Like other products, prices of enterprise software attempt to refl ect the economic value 
of that software to the customers. The usage patterns that affect the value of the software 
for a specifi c customer may themselves depend on customer size and industry as well as 
the strategy of that particular customer. While the value of enterprise software is highly 
related to usage, software producers often fi nd it disadvantageous to reveal their method 
of price calculation. One method of obfuscating the pricing formula is to use “complexity 
charges.”
For example, one utility billing software fi rm used a pricing formula that not only 
refl ected the number of bills the software would go on to produce, but also refl ected 
the type of bill produced. Commercial and industrial utility bills are far more complex 
in their construction than residential bills. As such, the software was more valuable 
to utility fi rms that had a higher proportion of commercial and industrial customers 
than those with a greater percentage of residential customers. To capture this value 
differential, the utility billing software fi rm added a “complexity charge” to refl ect the

portion of their customer’s revenue base that was derived from commercial and indus-
trial customers. 
NEGOTIATION
Finally, price segmentation can be executed through simple negotiation. Haggling for con-
sumer products is found throughout the world. In business markets, negotiation over fi nal 
price is a standard step within the sales process. In consumer markets, it is common for 
customers to haggle with suppliers over the price of almost all goods in many economies, 
ranging from premier cities, such as Dubai, to developing ones such as Mexico City, and 
even latent economies such as Abuja, Nigeria. 
Negotiation is perhaps the most direct attempt at uncovering a specifi c customer’s will-
ingness to pay, and therefore reaches towards complete price segmentation, yet it lacks 
precision. Negotiations are fraught with many biases from both the seller’s and the buyer’s 
position. The results from a negotiation are greatly dependent upon the preparation of 
the individual negotiating partners, perhaps as much as they are on the price sensitivity of 
the buyer. Therefore, they only partially reveal price sensitivity. Due to their imperfection, 
negotiations are only a marginally valuable price segmentation approach. 
Examples of Price Segmentation 
BANK FEES
Banks have long structured their prices to discourage profi t-destructive behavior.13 Unlike 
price segmentation that is driven by customer heterogeneity in willingness to pay, cost-
driven price segmentation is driven by customer heterogeneity in cost to serve. Bank fees 
tied to overdrafts and insuffi cient funds are constructed to discourage customers from 
attempting to withdraw more funds than they have available. Similar price incentives to 
discourage profi t-destroying behavior can be found with customer support fees with call 
centers, late payment fees by utilities, cash advance fees by credit cards and, more recently, 
baggage fees by airlines. 
Price segmentation strategies designed to discourage bad customer behavior yet end 
up forming the core source of profi tability should raise concerns among managers. Cus-
tomers fi nding themselves constantly subject to penalty fees will likely be less favorably 
inclined to the fi rm and thus more likely to switch suppliers once an alternative is made 
available. If customers paying penalty fees were otherwise unprofi table, losing their busi-
ness may be a satisfactory outcome. However, if they become a major source of profi ts, the 
fi rm will effectively be encouraging its most profi table customers to defect and be making 
itself vulnerable to the competition. 
Prices structured to discourage profi t-destructive behavior are common in many indus-
tries. For instance, consider the increasingly common practice of industrial fi rms charging 
for items that they previously provided for free to discourage waste. Alternatively, milk 
vendors may increase bottle deposit charges to encourage returns. 
TAVERN DRINKS
Neighborhood taverns may price beverages differently to price-segment those with a higher 
willingness to pay from those with a lower willingness to pay. For instance, consider the 
neighborhood tavern that sells both single malt scotch and beer on tap. Many jurisdictions 
place restrictions on the serving of alcohol, effectively giving those few establishments 
who have a license to sell tremendous pricing power over their patrons. In these taverns, 
the cost of scotch and beer represents only a small fragment of the price, and customer 
willingness to pay is the dominant driver to determining prices. Customers drinking single

Chapter 6 
Price Segmentation
malt scotch tend to have a higher willingness to pay than those who will select a common 
tap beer. Thus, the lone bar selling both single malt scotch and common tap beer is able to 
attract a larger customer base and extract disproportionately larger profi ts from the sale of 
single malt scotch than from the sale of tap beer. The tavern example is one of using a com-
mon location but attracting and profi ting from customers with differing temperaments of 
benefi ts sought and willingness to pay. 
While drinking establishments are perhaps among the leaders in price segmentation 
policies, they are not alone. Retail outlets can also practice demand-specifi c price segmen-
tation. The American Doll Place in Chicago sells dolls to many customers.14 However, 
customers seeking a greater experience and a broader set of benefi ts can expand their 
 relationship with the American Doll Place to include dining, doll repair, and even a doll 
beauty shop. (At one time, the American Doll Place also offered short theatrical produc-
tions featuring child actresses interacting with dolls.) As with taverns selling scotch and 
beer, the American Doll Place aggregates many customers to a single location and  allows 
them to self-segment into different buying groups, thus enabling those with a higher 
 willingness to pay for products the experience to do so. 
AIRLINES
Few industries use as many segmentation hedges as airlines. For starters, airlines segment 
customers according to willingness to pay in three major classes: fi rst class, business class, 
and coach. The basic benefi t of speedy transit is provided by all classes, but further ameni-
ties and services are provided in the transition from coach to business and eventually to 
fi rst class. This is one example of product-engineered segmentation hedges.
Further price segmentation is executed by airlines, even for the same city-pair trip, on 
the same day, with the same fl ight. Consider the use of Saturday night stayover require-
ments, advance notice requirements, and yield management practices. (Yield management 
is discussed in detail in Chapter 14.)
Saturday stayover requirements segment the weekend traveler from the business trav-
eler. The assumption is that weekend travelers are traveling for pleasure, and the fl ight 
faces greater competition in the form of driving instead of fl ying, or even forgoing or 
delaying the trip altogether. Meanwhile, business travelers have little maneuverability in 
their schedule and are more pressed for time. 
Advance notice requirements similarly attempt to segment the casual traveler from the 
more-time-pressed traveler. Customers who shop in advance of the trip have taken more 
time to consider their options and are thus likely to be more price-sensitive than those cus-
tomers who plan their travel closer to the time of travel, and they also are perhaps more 
pressed to take the trip.
Time of day and seasonal issues also infl uence prices of air travel. Morning and evening 
fl ights are priced differently than midday fl ights under the assumption that a morning fl yer 
has an afternoon meeting at the destination, with a returning fl ight that evening to avoid a 
hotel stay and enable a speedy return home. In contrast, transatlantic fl ights are cheaper in 
the early spring than in the midsummer vacation season or the winter holiday season. The 
seasonal variation in price is designed to target vacationers with less schedule fl exibility, 
such as parents with children, and profi t from their restrictions.
INDUSTRIAL MARKETS
Firms selling industrial products and inputs into other businesses’ products will combine a 
number of different price segmentation strategies. Many of these price segmentation strat-
egies, such as fi rmographics, complexity charges, usage patterns, purchase frequency, and 
order size, have already been discussed. Other more popular price segmentation hedges 
can be found in Exhibit 6-3.

Price Segmentation 
117
Summary
• Price segmentation is charging different prices to different customers or groups of 
customers.
• Willingness to pay varies between individual customers. This heterogeneity in 
willingness to pay creates the opportunity for fi rms to improve profi tability 
through price segmentation. In addition to heterogeneity in willingness to pay, price 
segmentation strategies require that products sold to one segment of the market 
have limited transferability to another segment in the market. Price segmentation 
improves profi ts by enabling the fi rm to capture a higher price from those 
customers who value the product higher and capture higher volumes at a lower 
price from customers with a lower willingness to pay.
• Price segmentation has been studied for many years. In its early form, it was 
described as either fi rst-, second-, or third-degree price discrimination depending 
upon its economic effi ciency. Later, authors categorized price segmentation 
strategies according to the information required as complete, direct, or indirect 
price segmentation. Yet a third approach has been simply to segregate those 
techniques that are used on a tactical basis from those used on a strategic price 
structure basis. 
• Segmentation hedges are used to separate customers who must pay more from 
those who will pay less. Good price segmentation hedges should be highly 
correlated with customers’ perception of value, require minimal information 
from customers, be enforceable based on objective criteria, and be culturally 
acceptable.
• Price segmentation hedges can be constructed on consumer demographic or 
industry fi rmographic data when these objective facts are correlated with 
willingness to pay.
• Time of purchase can signal willingness to pay, resulting in matinee prices, lunch 
specials, and early-bird specials. 
• Purchase location can signal willingness to pay, as observed with beverage price 
differentials between grocers, convenience stores, and restaurants.
• Temporary promotional sales, coupons, rebates, and buyer’s clubs are all forms of 
price segmentation wherein buyers self-identify through their actions of their price 
sensitivity and lowered willingness to pay.

Chapter 6 
Price Segmentation
• Product-engineered price segmentation uses the inclusion or exclusion of specifi c 
attributes, features, and benefi ts to defi ne segmentation hedges. Utility-sensitive 
customers with a greater willingness to pay will be encouraged to higher-priced 
products than those who require only basic functionality and have a lower 
willingness to pay.
• Quantity purchased can form a segmentation hedge. The quantity purchased can be 
signaled either through a single order or through the frequency of repeat purchases.
• When customer usage patterns are correlated with perceived benefi ts, fi rms can 
price products according to intended use. Metering and tie-ins are one form of 
price segmentation based on customer usage.

 5. An industrial fi rm has been offering a single standard fl at price. The sales team 
has requested that the fi rm offer discounts to a select group of customers. In 
constructing the discounting policy, the pricing manager decides to consider 
changing the standard price as well. Should the standard price remain the same, be 
lowered, or be raised in the presence of discounting based upon the information 
given and nothing more?
 6. Every Day Low Pricing (EDLP) has become a popular grocery store format. In 
contrast, some grocers have adhered to Hi-Lo pricing, in which the prices on 
specifi c products oscillate between a normal high price and a special discounted 
low price. 
 a. Based on the principle of price segmentation with perfect segmentation hedges, 
which store format can be anticipated to be the most profi table?
 b. In many cases, EDLP formats have proven to be more profi table than Hi-Lo 
formats. What does this imply with respect to the effectiveness of “special 
discounted prices” in forming a price segmentation hedge?

$100,000. In addition to problem 9’s questions, answer the following:
 a. When does price segmentation have a larger effect on profi ts under the 
condition of low marginal costs or high marginal costs?
Economic Model of Unit Prices and Price Segmentation
A simple economic model can demonstrate the power of price segmentation to increase 
both profi ts and the number of customers served. To demonstrate, consider a downward-
sloping demand curve and identify the optimal prices, their associated quantity sold, and 
resulting profi t under the conditions of using a single price versus using two prices with 
a perfect segmentation hedge using a standard profi t equation of the fi rm. The process is 
similar to that used in Appendix 2.B; it differs only in the form of the demand curve and 
the number of prices considered.
Let the demand be sloping downward linearly, as defi ned by 
Q 5 Qmax ?  ( 1 2  P 
__ 
S ) 
Eq. 6.1
S is the maximum utility that any customer can derive from the product and therefore is 
the highest price that can be charged. When the price equals the maximum utility (P 5 S), 
no units are sold. Similarly, Qmax is the maximum units that the market can purchase. 
When the price is zero (P 5 0), the demand is maximized (Q 5 Qmax). See Exhibit 6-4.
With a single price, we can use the familiar profi t equation of the fi rm of 
1 5 Q ? (P 2 V) 
Eq. 6.2
where  is profi t, Q is quantity sold, P is price, and V is the variable costs. We have 
set fi xed costs to zero to keep this example simple without losing generality. To fi nd the 
 optimal price, we take the fi rst derivative of profi ts with respect to price and set it equal to 
zero. The fi rst derivative of profi ts with respect to price is, from the fi rm’s profi t equation

Equations 6.5 to 6.7 defi ne the optimal price, units sold, and profi ts earned under the

two sources. (1) Profi ts will be gained from customers who purchase at a higher price. 
(2) Profi ts will be gained from customers who purchase at a lower price. In this case, we 
must optimize both prices simultaneously. See Exhibit 6-5.
In this case, we modify the familiar profi t equation of the fi rm to read
2 5 QH ? (PH 2 V) 1 (QL 2 QH) · (PL 2 V)

QH is the quantity sold at the higher price PH; and QL is the quantity sold that would be sold at 
the lower price in absence of a segmentation hedge. Hence QL 2 QH is the quantity sold 
at the lower price under the assumption of marketing the product with two prices and 
having a perfect segmentation hedge. The variable costs (V) are assumed to be unchanged

Interestingly, we can contrast the units sold under the condition of using a single price 
versus that of using two prices. With two prices, the fi rm will sell  QH units at the higher 
price and QL 2 QH units at the lower price, for a total of QL units. Comparing the optimal 
units sold under at two prices (QL* in Eq. 6.15) to the optimal units sold at a single price 
(Q* in Eq. 6.6) we fi nd

Eq. 6.18
The fi rm will sell fully one-third more units with two price segments than it will sell with a 
single price when prices are optimized against a downward-sloping, linear demand curve. 
Hence, optimal price segmentation is predicted to enable a product to be more widely 
purchased and used than without it. 
Similarly, we can contrast the fi rm’s profi ts under the condition of using a single price 
versus that of using two prices. Comparing Equations 6.7 to 6.17 we fi nd

Eq. 6.19
The fi rm likewise earns one-third higher profi ts with two price segments than it earns 
with a single price when prices are optimized against a downward-sloping, linear demand 
curve. Hence, optimizing prices with multiple price segments is predicted to improve a 
fi rm’s profi ts over that which can be achieved with a single price.
As for price, the unit volume–weighted average price at which a unit is sold using 
two prices and perfect segmentation is the same as it is when the product is sold at only 
one price when prices are optimized against a downward-sloping, linear demand curve. 
Price segmentation does not need to raise prices overall to improve profi ts and increase
the number of customers served—it needs only to segregate those who are willing to pay 
more from those who are not.
Notes
1 Modeling market dynamics with the restriction that every customer purchases only one unit is a simplifying 
assumption. It has little results on the conclusion of the thought experiment, but it makes the discussion 
easier.

ustomers ask for a discount almost immediately after prices have been set, and

price promotions. As a source of price variance, or pricing at points other than that 
determined in the price-setting process, price promotions are the most common challenge 
facing executives. Furthermore, price promotions can improve profi ts, but they can also 
harm profi ts, adding complexity to the challenge of their management.1 Because of their

frequency and complexity, few other issues will occupy a pricing professional’s time more 
than that of managing price promotions. 
Price promotions come in many forms. In their most discrete form, price discounts may 
be granted to specifi c customers to secure their purchase. In a broader sense, coupons, 
trial offers, trade deals, promotional sales, promotional discounts, promotional bundles, 
rebates, and specially marked packages can all be treated as price promotions. 
Designed well, price promotions will improve profi tability through their ability to 
price-segment the market. They capture sales from customers who have a lower willing-
ness to pay at a lower price point, while leaving those customers who are willing to pay 
the full price to do so. If they are designed poorly, price promotions will harm profi tability. 
As a form of price segmentation, price promotions tend to be “leaky,” in that customers 
with a higher willingness to pay may benefi t from a price promotion even though a price 
concession is not needed to secure their purchase. Left unchecked, poorly designed price 
promotions fail to act as a segmentation hedge and end up providing unnecessary, profi t-
destructive price concessions. 
Because of their ability to improve profi ts, price promotions have become highly popular. 
At the time of this writing, the corporate expenditures on promotions have far exceeded 
outlays on advertising. For instance, in 1990, over 90 billion coupons were distributed. Since 
the advent of the Internet, online coupons and price promotions have only multiplied. 
To make better decisions, managers need to understand the tradeoffs involved in price 
promotions. Like other aspects of pricing, price promotions have both quantitative and 
qualitative dimensions. Executives should consistently temper their desire for volume and 
the results of a profi t sensitivity analysis with an understanding of the ability of a specifi c 
price promotion to act as a segmentation hedge. Price promotions that fail to act as a 
s egmentation hedge should be discarded and replaced with a more targeted format.
Let us examine some of the positive and negative aspects of price promotions before 
comparing a few of the more popular formats side by side.
Positive Eﬀ ects of Price Promotions
Price promotions have many attractive attributes for an executive looking to boost the top 
line. Price promotions can enable price segmentation effectively, thus both increasing the 
reachable market and potentially enabling an overall increase of the list price to capture 
higher prices from those with a higher willingness to pay. They also have an immediate im-
pact on volume sold by both encouraging new customers to participate in the category and 
encouraging customers to try the promoted brand and potentially realign their loyalties. 
PRICE SEGMENTATION
Positioning price promotion in the context of price segmentation hedges helps us reveal 
many of the positive aspects and methods of improving price promotions.2 We have seen 
that price segmentation can improve profi tability by enabling the fi rm to charge a higher 
price to those with a higher willingness to pay, and increase volume of product sold by 
charging a lower price to those with a lower willingness to pay. Therefore, the effi ciency of 
price promotions as a segmentation hedge is largely determined by how well they segment 
the market according to willingness to pay.
A pricing policy that uses highly targeted price promotions improves profi tability 
through the same mechanisms as those found with other segmentation hedges. First and 
most directly, price promotions are best at capturing marginal customers and encour-
aging them to purchase, thus increasing the volume sold (albeit at a lower price). Sec-
ond, through indirect effects, price promotions can actually enable the fi rm to increase 
the “normal” price—that is, the price extracted through non-promotional transactions.

The effect of having a lower promotional price, even if it is only temporary and used by 
a small portion of the market, is to enable those customers with a low willingness to pay 
to purchase at a lower price. Once they have purchased, the remaining market will see an
increase in the representation of customers with a higher willingness to pay. As such, 
the fi rm may be able to price the product slightly higher, in proportion to the marginal 
 increase of the remaining customers’ average willingness to pay.
If price promotions are simply a form of price segmentation, a curious reader might 
ask why price segmentation related to temporary price actions are nearly always posed 
as “discounts.” After all, the effect of many price promotions is to toggle the price level 
between two different prices, one being the “normal price” and the other being the “dis-
counted price.” Why not rename the lower price as “normal” and the higher price as the 
“premium” price (or some other acceptable name)? 
Prospect theory provides a simple explanation. Recall from prospect theory that people 
feel the pain of losses more than they feel the joy of gains. Price increases, either in sur-
charges or in temporary price hikes, are interpreted by customers as a loss from an earlier 
lower price. Price decreases, either through discounts or sales, are always seen as a gain 
from an earlier higher price. As such, price toggling between a “normal” and “discount” 
price will have less effect of depressing demand during the high-price period than those 
that toggle between a “premium” and “normal” price level. Even though the actual price 
levels may be the same, the framing effect implies that the name used to describe the low- 
and high-price levels affects customer response.
MARKET SIZE AND SHARE
During a price promotion, sales can increase substantially. For the manufacturer, increased 
sales come from two different sources: market size increases and brand switching.3 For 
the retailer, increased sales come not only from those related to the promoted product, but 
also from other products at the store, especially complementary products. 
Market size increases, or increased category-level spending, can occur because a price 
promotion may potentially lower the price required to participate in the market. The 
lower price draws marginal customers, customers who otherwise would not purchase 
from that category of goods, into the market. In this manner, price promotions can
increase the size of the market. 
Brand switching occurs because the specifi c product on promotion has improved its 
value proposition in relation to competing products within its category.4 While price 
p romotions lower the cost to purchase, they do not lower the benefi ts gained in purchas-
ing, and they may even increase them due to the effect of a discount being perceived as a 
gain. Customers who are marginally loyal to a competing product may calculate that their 
overall utility will be greater by switching brands and purchasing the promoted product. 
This can induce brand switching during the promotion, the trial of competing products, 
and perhaps even the capture of customers who are now loyal to the new brand. When 
price promotions lead to the capture of new brand-loyal customers, they can have a very 
high impact on overall market share and profi tability.5
We have seen evidence that price promotions both increase category-level purchases 
and encourage brand switching from the examination of elasticity of demand. Recall that 
category-level elasticity of demand is regularly observed to be less than brand-level elas-
ticity of demand. The difference can be attributed to the fact that category-level elasticity 
of demand refl ects the ability of a pricing action to increase the size of the market alone, 
while brand-level elasticity of demand refl ects the ability of a pricing action both to in-
crease the size of the market and to induce brand switching. The difference implies that, 
for most price promotions, sales increases come primarily from brand switching and sec-
ondarily from market size growth.

Negative Eﬀ ect of Price Promotions
Much of the positive impact of price promotions, however, can be misleading. For
instance, short-term sales data may indicate that a price promotion increases profi tability, 
yet long-term sales and revenue data can contradict that. To make sense of the confl ict, 
let’s look at some of the negative impacts of price promotions. 
IMPERFECT SEGMENTATION HEDGE 
Price promotions are, at best, an imperfect segmentation hedge. Although they can induce 
some customers who would not otherwise buy to do so, they also can provide unnecessary 
price concessions to otherwise loyal customers.6 Promotional design has a signifi cant impact 
on the ability of a price promotion to discriminate between those with a higher willingness to 
pay and those with a lower willingness to pay, as we will see in future sections. 
A potential source of sales increases during price promotions is the acceleration of pur-
chases by customers who would have purchased anyway.7 If customers are purchasing excess 
quantities for consumption, the price promotion will lead to an overall growth of the market 
and therefore improve profi ts. However, if customers are using price promotions to stockpile 
products, the sales that occur during a price promotion will come from those sales that would 
have occurred during a future period without a price promotion. This is one of several routes 
in which a price promotion can actually decrease demand during regular-priced periods.
CUSTOMER CHURN
As noted, price promotions can encourage brand switching. While encouraging brand trial 
will improve sales during the price promotion, one of the key metrics of the long-term suc-
cess of a price promotion is the ability of the product to capture brand-loyal customers 
during regular price times. If consumers switch back to competing products following the 
fi rm’s price promotion or during a competitor’s price promotion, much of the potential gains 
derived from a price promotion will be lost quickly. Industries plagued with numerous and 
frequent price promotions may also be creating their own customer churn, encouraging 
customers to switch between brands during a promotion and failing to foster any long-term 
brand commitment. Customer churn has its own set of profi t-damaging consequences. 
Price promotions can have asymmetric effects on profi tability between competing fi rms, 
where those products that are able to engender stronger brand loyalty are at a strategic 
advantage. The asymmetric effect of price promotions in delivering profi tability to the 
fi rm with higher brand loyalty is one of the progenitor factors that encourage marketing 
managers of branded goods to favor price promotions when battling the encroachment of 
generic or store-brand products. 
Cross-elasticity of demand between products is a strategic metric of the ability of a 
price promotion to take and keep market share. The cross-elasticity of demand measures 
the ability of a specifi c product to take market share from a competing product. The 
higher a product’s cross-elasticity of demand, the stronger that brand is compared to other 
products. If the price promotion takes market share from a product with a weaker brand 
loyalty, it may improve market share in the long term. If, however, the price promotion 
takes market share from products with strong brand loyalty, it is unlikely that customer 
trial will translate into a realignment of brand loyalty. 
REFERENCE PRICE EFFECT
Though price promotions as a part of a price segmentation policy can lead to higher “reg-
ular” prices during non-promotional periods, many marketing executives fi nd that raising 
prices after a price promotion is very diffi cult.8 As discussed with respect to the reference

price effect, one model of how customers perceive prices shows an exponential smooth-
ing of price expectations. In this model, the current price that customers expect to pay is 
informed by the last price observed. Following a price promotion, prices return to their 
regular level from the latest promotional level. However, at this regular price, customers 
may perceive the price to be too high because it is above what they last paid.
The strength of exponential smoothing on price expectations is reinforced by the depth 
and frequency of price promotions. Frequent price promotions reinforce the expectation 
of lower prices and thus encourage customers to expect lower prices.9 Likewise, deep price 
promotions are likely to have greater saliency within customers’ minds and thus also lead 
to lower price expectations. 
LOSS OF PRICE CREDIBILITY
One way of speaking about the negative effect of price promotions on regular prices is the 
concept of losing price credibility. When the price fl uctuates wildly between promotional 
levels and regular levels, and customers begin to notice the wide differential, they may sim-
ply stop buying at full price. The full price simply becomes non-credible as an acceptable 
price for purchasing, and all customers will hunt for the next outlet or the next sale date 
to purchase unless they are facing an emergency.
Many fi rms in industrial markets have lost list price credibility. From offi ce supplies 
to enterprise software, even the smallest business can fi nd routes around paying full list 
prices. Discounts are so numerous that it is hard to avoid them. Furthermore, purchasing 
managers know that industrial products can be purchased at a discount, and many are 
actually rewarded by the discount they receive below the list price. When it becomes com-
mon knowledge that “no one pays full price,” suppliers must conclude that the list price 
has lost all credibility.
An old joke about price promotions goes as follows: “Our normal price is $1,000, but 
right now it has a $999 discount.” If customers even come close to perceiving this about a 
fi rm’s list prices, then that fi rm can be assured that it has lost all pricing credibility.
INCREASE OF PRICE SENSITIVITY
Perhaps the largest long-term challenge of price promotions derives from their focus 
on price itself. Price promotions, by their very nature, draw attention to price. When 
they do this, price promotions can take attention away from the issue of product value, 
the features and attributes that give rise to benefi ts from which customers derive utility.
Research has demonstrated that benefi t-focused promotions can improve the perceived 
value of a product, while price-oriented promotions increase price sensitivity. Firms seek-
ing to improve their leverage over prices are encouraged to pay less attention to couponing 
and price promotions and instead focus on other methods of driving sales. 
Managing Vagueness
At issue in price promotion with relationship to price credibility and pricing power is a chal-
lenge of vagueness. Vagueness is a philosophical issue deriving from the Sorites pardox. The 
name “sorites” derives from the Greek word soros, meaning “heap,” and refers to a thought 
puzzle known as “the heap.” “The heap” thought puzzle goes as follows: How many grains 
of wheat does it take to make a heap? Would you describe a single grain of wheat as a heap? 
Of course not. Would you describe two grains of wheat as a heap? Again, no. . . . Yet, you 
must admit the presence of a heap sooner or later as you add grains of wheat. So, how many 
grains of wheat does it take to make a heap? Alternatively, let’s try it from the opposite 
direction. If you have a heap of wheat and take one away, is it still a heap? Yes. Would you 
describe it as a heap if you take two grains of wheat away? Again, yes. . . . Yet once more,

you must admit the absence of a heap sooner or later as you take grains of wheat. So, which 
grain of wheat makes the difference between a heap and a non-heap? 
In a similar manner, it is clear that price promotions can improve profi ts by driving 
marginal sales from customers with a lower willingness to pay. However, it is also clear 
that excess price promotions can have a negative impact on profi ts by decreasing price 
credibility and encouraging loyal customers to buy on price rather than value. Questions 
like “How many price promotions are too many?” and “How deep a price promotion is 
too deep?” are somewhat vague. It is hard to say that the last price promotion was exactly 
one too many, but at some point, there clearly were too many price promotions. When 
there are too many price promotions, taking just one away won’t make it right.
To determine if a specifi c price promotion should be used, executives typically deploy 
a profi t sensitivity analysis as a fi rst step. A priori, volume increases are forecasted in con-
junction with a specifi c price promotion, along with redemption rates and other cost fac-
tors depending on the format of the promotion. Then, after quantitatively defi ning volume 
hurdles, executives determine if a specifi c price promotion is likely to improve profi ts. See 
Chapter 2 to refresh the details. 
While this method can prevent managers from executing the most egregious errors in 
price promotions, it fundamentally fails to address the subtle challenge of how many is too 
many. Further models are required to differentiate between price promotions that enhance 
profi ts and market share and those that negatively affect price credibility or excessively 
draw sales from those that would have occurred in the absence of a price promotion. 
Often, a more-complete quantitative model requires much more managerial effort and 
facts that can be gathered only through market research efforts. Due to the high popular-
ity and frequency of price promotions and the effort required to execute price promotions, 
many executives conclude that a detailed quantitative analysis beyond a profi t sensitivity 
analysis of specifi c price promotions is economically ineffi cient. Instead, they resort to 
periodic reviews of the overall promotional policy. In the absence of a detailed quantita-
tive analysis on specifi c price promotions, many executives fi nd that a well-constructed 
qualitative analysis that considers both the positive and negative effects of price promo-
tion policy fruitful and economically effi cient.
One such method for quantitatively evaluating price promotions has been proposed 
by Neslin and Shoemaker specifi cally for couponing in consumer markets.10 The model 
considers the actions of manufacturers, retailers, and customers, and furthermore includes 
decisions taken both before and after the price promotion period. While the details of 
this model are beyond the scope of this text, an overview of the interactions and issues 
included their coupon promotion model is provided in Exhibit 7-1. From the coupon 
promotion model diagram alone, one can determine that numerous factors must be con-
sidered to manage the vagueness regarding how many price promotions are too many. 
Price Promotion Design
In addition to the quantitative guidelines provided through a profi t sensitivity analysis, 
managers can rely on four general qualitative rules to price promotions: Make them 
 targeted. Make them temporary. Make them special. Make them irregular.
TARGETED
Targeted price promotions are better at price segmentation than more-diffuse price pro-
motions. For a price promotion to act as a strong price segmentation hedge, it should 
specifi cally encourage marginal customers to purchase. Marginal customers are those who 
would have chosen not to purchase in the absence of the promotion, but otherwise desire 
to purchase. Without the price promotion, marginal customers may have purchased a

competing brand, delayed their purchase and reduced their consumption, or simply not 
have participated in the market at all. Customers who would have purchased anyway 
without the price promotion should be avoided, if possible, in a price promotion campaign.
The importance of targeting marginal customers can override many simpler metrics of 
price promotional effectiveness such as coupon redemption rates and volume increases. 
If the targeted price promotion selectively attracts only a few customers, but they are 
specifi cally those who otherwise would not purchase, it may be more effi cient as a market-
ing tool than a promotion that is widely and indiscriminately used by both brand-loyal 
and marginal customers alike. Identifying promotions that target marginal customers may
require examining data beyond that of redemption rates and into data that reveals buyer 
pre- and post-purchase intentions. 
TEMPORARY
Price promotions should be temporary and time-dependent. One of the positive aspects of 
price promotions is their ability to increase sales immediately. They are, in nature, tempo-
rary marketing efforts that involve pricing actions that encourage customers to purchase. 
In contrast, a long-running price promotion will eventually fail to maintain the quality of 
being temporary and therefore morphs into the quality of being a new price level.
Recall that one of the negative effects of price promotions is the potential for resetting 
reference prices, or customer-expected prices. Long-running price promotions have greater 
saliency. They increase the likelihood that customers will remember the lower price paid 
during the promotion and make it easier for customers to recall that lower price. Short, 
temporary price promotions are more likely to stay in short-term memory and less likely

to be stored in long-term memory. Thus, to reduce the potential for a price promotion to 
reset price expectations, it should be temporary.
SPECIAL
When possible, price promotions should be positioned as special, such as related to a unique 
event or a reward to specifi c customer groups. Making a price promotion special reduces the 
potential for customers to perceive it as the new, regular price. It reinforces the perception 
that a price promotion is a unique, singular event that does not refl ect future prices. 
Not all price promotions will be special. Many of the coupons prepared by manufac-
turers are valid for up to a year following publication. While some price promotions are 
neither temporary nor special, they may still retain the qualities of sound price promotion 
policy if they meet the requirement of being highly targeted. 
IRREGULAR
In keeping with the desire to avoid resetting price expectations, some manufacturers have 
turned to using irregular price promotions. Irregularity is found in timing, such as pricing 
the product at $2, $2.20, and $2.40 at various times but varying the inter-promotion delay 
in an irregular pattern. Irregularity can also be found in depth, such as using successive 
price promotions at $2 plus a small random multiple of three cents. Research has shown 
that such irregularity can reduce the impact of price promotions on price expectations.11
Examination of Popular Forms of Price Promotions
COUPONS
Manufacturer coupons are perhaps the most proliferative form of price promotions, but 
not all coupons are equally valuable for the fi rm. Manufacturer coupons can appear on 
product packages, in direct mail, in newspaper cutouts, on websites, and within email.
Retailers themselves provide direct-mail coupons, repeat-purchase coupons, receipt cou-
pons, and in-store coupons, and the formats of coupons change daily. Depending on their 
format, different coupon programs have different effi ciencies in their ability to price-
segment the market and in their effectiveness in increasing promotional period sales.
To demonstrate some of the decision tradeoffs that are embedded in any price pro-
motion using coupons, let us consider manufacturer coupons specifi cally. Manufacturer-
supported coupons can be coordinated with specifi c retailers in a coordinated marketing 
effort, or they can be distributed directly by the manufacturer to consumers. Each choice 
represents a tradeoff. 
When coupons are coordinated with retailers, the effect is that of a double-edged sword. 
On the positive side, coordinating with retailers greatly improves the effectiveness of the cou-
pons in increasing sales volume and may enable the manufacturer to negotiate better shelf 
space and in-store displays. On the negative side, promotions coordinated with retailers can 
increase the proportion of coupon-using customers who would have purchased without the 
coupon, thus decreasing the economic effi ciency as a price segmentation hedge. 
To reduce the negative profi t impact of providing unnecessary price concessions to 
otherwise-willing-to-pay customers, manufacturer-retailer price promotions should be 
highly temporary. The temporary nature of these promotions acts as a form of segmenta-
tion hedge. Those who are searching for a discount should fi nd it available only in limited 
locations and for a limited time. In forcing customers to shop at a particular moment and 
place so they can receive the discount, customers with a higher willingness to pay and
alternative priorities may fi nd the offer inconvenient, while marginal customers with a 
lower willingness to pay may fi nd the offer suffi cient to encourage purchasing.

Manufacturer coupons placed within packaging will attract a higher proportion of 
repeat customers and, as such, might have a different kind of benefi cial infl uence. If 
these repeat customers are accelerating their consumption of the product in relation 
to the coupon on the packaging, the coupon will have the benefi cial effect of margin-
ally increasing the market. Alternatively, if the coupon in the packaging reduces the 
likelihood of brand switching to competitors, the manufacturer can anticipate that the 
couponing strategy will improve brand loyalty. 
Alternatively, direct-mail, web, newspaper, and magazine coupons can have the benefi -
cial aspect of reaching a broader audience. Though typically more expensive to distribute, 
the broader audience reached by these communication channels implies the potential of 
reaching a higher proportion of prospective customers who otherwise would have little
interaction with the brand. If the coupon distributed through these broader communica-
tion methods induces a higher portion of sales to new, brand-switching customers, manu-
facturers may fi nd them more effi cient even though the redemption rate is lower. 
In general, coupons are a decent, although imperfect, price segmentation hedge. Cus-
tomers who use coupons are signaling their lower willingness to pay through the action of 
identifying, collecting, and redeeming their coupons. Meanwhile, customers with a higher 
opportunity cost of time or with a higher willingness to pay for other reasons may fi nd the 
couponing process inordinately wasteful.
TRIAL OFFERS
Trial offers are simple price promotions that the seller uses to induce trial of its product. 
Trial offers are made in the form of free samples, small packages priced at a signifi cantly 
lower price point, or leased services and software as a service wherein the cost to enter the 
market is greatly reduced from the full, regular price. 
In some formats, trial offers make it clear that the trial price is discounted from the reg-
ular price. In other formats, the benefi ts of the trial offer are reduced from that provided 
with the regular offer by shrinking the package size, automatically curtailing functionality, 
or simply providing only partial functionality. Because these trial offers are clearly not
intended for regular use nor represent the regular price, they mitigate some of the chal-
lenges of inappropriately setting the reference price too low. 
When targeted to new customers, they can effectively act to increase the market overall 
and, more specifi cally, increase the trial of the manufacturer’s brand. A buyer’s fi rst pur-
chase is not just incremental revenue; it is the fi rst opportunity to educate the buyer on the 
value of the product. With experience goods, use enables customers to learn the benefi ts of 
the product that could not be fully comprehended through another process, and therefore 
trial offers greatly facilitate market penetration. 
Trial offers as a means of introducing products to new customers should be used with 
products that will be purchased frequently, have a low incremental production cost, and 
have benefi ts that are self-evident after one use. 
REBATES
Rebates provide a monetary incentive to purchase, like other forms of price promotion. 
They provide advantages in their ability to be highly targeted in the type of customers who 
redeem rebates and to whom the rebate is extended.
When rebates are extended, redemption rates may be low. Even with low redemption 
rates, the rebate may have a strong positive effect on profi tability. Many customers fi nd 
rebate offers attractive at the time of purchase and are encouraged to purchase because 
of the rebate, and yet these same customers will often fail to redeem the rebate. Failure to 
redeem can be attributed to many factors, yet mostly they represent opportunity costs on 
behalf of the customer. It takes time to complete the rebate forms, attach receipts, and mail

them in. Customers failing in any one of these steps before the expiration of the rebate 
offer are effectively signaling their higher willingness to pay. In this sense, rebate offers are 
highly effective in segmenting customers by willingness to pay.
Rebates do not have to be extended to all customers. They can be targeted at repeat 
customers only as a means of fostering brand loyalty, or at new customers only as a means 
to encourage product trial. In some cases, rebates will be targeted specifi cally to customers 
who “trade in” a competitor’s model, though the economic profi tability of such deals are 
highly dependent on future purchases and customer longevity. In this sense, rebates should 
be related to accomplishing a specifi c strategic marketing goal.
PROMOTIONAL BUNDLES
Firms can use promotional bundles to disguise price promotions. Promotional bundling, 
like bundling in general, is the sale of two or more distinct products in a single transaction 
and at a single price. The bundled price of the two or more products is lower than the 
total prices of the individual constituent products. Unlike strategic bundling, promotional 
bundles are temporary in nature, related to a specifi c tactical marketing effort.
Research has found that promotional bundles are more effective at encouraging brand 
switching among marginal customers than in encouraging new customers to purchase 
the product. Further research has examined whether customers who purchase a promo-
tional bundle view their savings as (1) being associated with an individual or dominant 
item within the bundle or (2) being associated with the entire bundle, where no specifi c 
product was perceived as providing the brunt of the price reduction. Encouragingly, the 
promotional bundle is perceived primarily as granting savings on the entire bundle, not on 
a single product. As such, bundles should have less effect on resetting price expectation of 
any individual product compared to other price promotion formats.12 
Tradeoﬀ s between Popular Price Promotions
There are a number of common discount approaches. When executives are choosing
between different price promotions, they should consider the tradeoffs involved. Compet-
ing forms of price promotions can be evaluated according to the ability to segment cus-
tomers according to willingness to pay and the fi t with the overall price promotion design 
suggestions. For example, we compare newspaper versus in-store coupons, mail-in versus 
instant rebates, and Every Day Low Pricing (EDLP) versus Hi-Lo pricing formats.
NEWSPAPER VERSUS IN-STORE COUPONS
Guided by redemption rates and improved sales volumes alone, many marketing manag-
ers may be led to believe that in-store coupons are more effi cient than those distributed by 
newspaper, direct mail, or other means to customers. Coupons sent to individuals tend to 
have a low redemption rate, not unlike the low conversion rate found with other direct-
mail approaches. Conversion rates of 1 percent to 2 percent are common with direct-
mail efforts, making direct mail an expensive promotional effort for fi rms. In contrast, 
in-store coupons have a very high redemption rate related to the fact that in-store coupons 
are closer to the point of purchase. If redemption rates alone were the metric of choice, 
many marketers could believe in-store coupons to be more effi cient than those distrib-
uted through newspapers or other channels. Yet redemption rates are not the entire story. 
M arketers should also consider the targeting effi ciency and the associated costs. 
Many customers who redeem an in-store coupon are the same customers who would 
have purchased the product at full price. In contrast, those who redeem coupons delivered 
by newspaper cutouts, direct mail, web, or email tend to be more marginal customers, 
customers with a lower willingness to pay who would not purchase without the incentive.

The targeting ineffi ciency of in-store coupons may make them actually less economically 
effi cient for the manufacturer than those distributed to a larger audience.
Couponing is always associated with a cost. Not only is the face value of a redeemed cou-
pon a reduction in the price captured, but other costs also are involved, including those as-
sociated with printing and distributing coupons and coupon-processing fees. Low redemption 
rates and high distribution costs can increase the costs of couponing dramatically. In contrast, 
high redemption rates and low distribution costs can make the couponing appear effi cient. 
To incorporate both the effects of targeting effi ciency and total couponing costs, one 
should calculate the break-even incremental unit sales per redemption.13 Incremental 
unit sales per redemption measure the number of incremental sales generated by the cou-
pon divided by the number of coupons redeemed. The break-even incremental unit sales 
per redemption defi ne the required percentage of coupons redeemed to have come from
incremental sales, or sales that would not have happened in the absence of the coupon. 
In Exhibit 7-2, we present a sample calculation of the break-even incremental unit sales 
per redemption of a branded good manufacturer distributing a $0.50 coupon with a $0.09 
processing fee per coupon when considering the distribution of coupons via the newspaper 
or an in-store display. Assume that the product has a manufacturer-to-retailer price of $3, 
with a 40 percent manufacturer’s profi t margin. 
If distributed via newspapers, we might anticipate the distribution of 1 million coupons at 
$10 per thousand coupons with a 5 percent redemption rate, yielding a total of 50,000 coupons 
at a distribution cost of $10,000. In contrast, the same branded-good manufacturer could dis-
tribute 62,500 in-store coupons at cost of $100 per thousand with an 80 percent redemption 
rate to yield the same total of 50,000 coupons redeemed for only $6,250 in distribution cost.

Both approaches would have the same redemption costs, or costs associated with redeem-
ing and processing. At $0.59 per coupon redeemed ($0.50 coupon 1 $0.09 processing fee), 
50,000 coupons would have a $29,500 redemption cost. If we add the distribution costs to the 
redemption costs to fi nd the total coupon campaign costs, we would fi nd the total campaign 
costs associated with newspaper distribution to be $39,500 and the total campaign costs
associated with in-store distribution to be $35,750. Dividing the total costs by the number 
of coupons redeemed, we fi nd the cost per buyer to be $0.79 for newspaper distribution and 
$0.715 for in-store distribution. On the face of costs alone, we might conclude that in-store 
distribution is more effi cient. However, such a conclusion would be premature.
We could also calculate the campaign profi t generated from the couponing effort to 
determine the return on investment for the campaigns. Given that 50,000 coupons are 
redeemed in both cases, and that the product is priced at $3 with a 40 percent profi t mar-
gin, the profi t from either campaign is $60,000. The return on investment is the campaign 
profi t generated minus the campaign costs, and then divided by the campaign costs. For 
newspaper distribution, the return on investment for the campaign is 52 percent. For
in-store distribution, the return on investment for the campaign would be 68 percent. 
Again, on the face of return on investment alone, we might conclude that in-store distribu-
tion is more effi cient—but such a conclusion remains premature.
Cost is not the only factor to consider when evaluating couponing. Rather, the effi ciency 
of couponing should be evaluated based on its ability to generate new sales—sales that would 
not have occurred in the absence of the coupon. Fundamentally, we desire the portion of the 
campaign profi t that can be attributed to incremental sales to be greater than the campaign 
costs (Equation 7.1).
Campaign Profi t  Percent Associated with Incremental Sales . Campaign Costs 
                                 Eq. 7.1
We can rearrange Equation 7.1 to fi nd the break-even incremental unit sales per redemption 
(Equation 7.2):
Break-even Incremental Unit Sales per Redemption 5  Campaign Costs 
 
_______________ 
 
Campaign Profi t 
 Eq. 7.2
For coupons distributed via the newspaper, we fi nd the break-even incremental unit 
sales per redemption to be 66 percent, meaning that 66 percent of the sales associated 
with the coupon must come from customers who would not have purchased in the
absence of the coupon. If research indicates that newspaper coupons are good at targeting 
incremental sales, such that 70 percent of coupon users come from incremental sales, the 
manufacturer may conclude that newspaper coupon distribution is the effi cient approach. 
In contrast, we fi nd break-even incremental unit sales per redemption to be 60 percent 
for in-store coupons. The lower break-even point for in-store coupons over newspaper 
coupons is a direct result of the higher redemption rates. Yet, if research indicates that
in-store coupons are poor at targeting incremental sales, such that only 30 percent of 
coupon users come from incremental sales, the manufacturer may conclude that in-store 
coupon distribution is an ineffi cient approach. 
Clearly, calculating the break-even incremental unit sales per redemption is useful for 
decision making. It also heightens the importance of selecting coupon distribution chan-
nels not only based on the effective cost per coupon redeemed, but also the effectiveness 
of coupons in attracting new sales. Much research has cast serious doubt on the belief that 
fi rms routinely achieve incremental sales in excess of the break-even point. 
Where customers make purchase decisions, either at home or in the store, infl uences the 
optimal choice between direct-to-customer or in-store coupons. Products whose purchase 
is driven by a predefi ned need and that are selected by customers coming to the store with 
a list are likely to receive a more signifi cant and lasting profi t boost through direct-mail

coupons or other broadly circulated coupon distribution methods. In-store coupons may 
provide a signifi cant and lasting profi t improvement when placed near the product, when 
they are used to promote trial or brand switching, and when purchasing decisions are 
made mostly at the point of sale. 
MAIL-IN VERSUS INSTANT REBATES
Similar to direct mail versus in-store coupons, mail-in versus instant rebates differ widely 
on their redemption rates and targeting effi ciency. Instant rebates are a poorer segmenta-
tion hedge than mail-in rebates, in that they are extended to customers with high and low 
willingness to pay alike. Mail-in rebates, through their requirement of completing a form, 
attaching a receipt, and mailing in the rebate request, are a better segmentation hedge 
to target than those with a lower willingness to pay. Experience has shown that mail-in 
rebate redemption rates vary between 5 percent and 50 percent, depending on the magni-
tude of the rebate, while in-store rebates regularly reach redemption rates of 100 percent. 
Because of the lower segmentation effi ciency of instant rebates in comparison to mail-
in rebates, it is suggested that the value of an instant rebate should be less than that of a 
comparable mail-in rebate after adjusting for its lower redemption rate (Equation 7.3). 
Instant Rebate Value , Mail-in Rebate Value  Mail-in Rebate Redemption Rate
 
 
Eq. 7.3
As with coupons, consumer behavioral factors that may sway the choice to use lower 
values for instant rebates than for mail-in rebates are those that indicate that product 
selection between competing offers is made in-store as opposed to at home when prepar-
ing a written list.
HI-LO VERSUS EDLP 
Hi-Lo shopping formats and EDLP shopping formats attract very different types of con-
sumer behavior. Hi-Lo formats, where coupons and price promotions are used frequently 
to drive sales, tend to cycle prices on specifi c products between high “regular” levels and 
low “sales” levels. EDLP formats eschew price promotions in favor of holding prices at a 
consistently low level. While some retailers are blatantly Hi-Lo channels, others advertise 
an EDLP strategy even though they tend to participate in some, albeit less frequent and 
shallower, Hi-Lo price promotions. Moreover, manufacturers themselves may, at times, 
announce a move towards EDLP. 
EDLP retailers disproportionately attract customers with a lower willingness to pay, 
while full-service retailers tend to attract customers with both low and high willing-
ness to pay.14 Because EDLP formats tend to attract more marginal customers, many 
manufacturers fi nd that granting these channels price concessions is an effective means 
to improve profi ts while having a minimal impact on sales through alternative channels 
to customers with a higher willingness to pay. Furthermore, because EDLP channels 
position themselves as a discount retailer to attract price-conscious customers, price 
actions through EDLP channels are somewhat, though not completely, isolated from 
those at other channels. 
As mentioned, Hi-Lo and EDLP retailers attract different kinds of customers in other
dimensions as well. For instance, EDLP formats also tend to attract big-basket shoppers who 
buy a wider variety and greater number of goods on a single shopping trip, than do Hi-Low 
formats. Other differences relate to the effect of reference prices and requirements for service.
In terms of reference price effects, EDLP shoppers tend to have a stronger expectation 
about prices than Hi-Lo shoppers, perhaps because EDLP shoppers routinely see the same 
price. Oddly however, EDLP shoppers tend to be less sensitive to short-term discounting 
than Hi-Lo shoppers—exactly those kinds of price changes related to a price promotion.

Chapter 7

These incongruous claims may be due to EDLP store formats lulling customers into
expecting low prices, thus encouraging them not to search elsewhere for discounts.15 
If EDLP retailers have a consistent price and Hi-Lo retailers have a fl uctuating price be-
tween high and low levels, which format tends to have lower prices on average? It is economi-
cally effi cient for specifi c Hi-Lo prices to be lower than EDLP prices on a temporary basis. On 
average, however, prices in Hi-Lo retail outlets are higher than prices in EDLP retail outlets.16
EDLP channels often require manufacturers to provide them with the lowest prices con-
sistently. This can create strain for manufacturers in dealing with their other channels. One 
strategy to mitigate this confl ict of interest is to offer different versions of the product to EDLP 
and Hi-Lo retail channels. Through variation in size, packaging, or even features, EDLP and 
Hi-Lo channels can distribute different products. Because Hi-Lo channels capture more cus-
tomers with a higher willingness to pay, it can further be argued that the EDLP channel should 
receive feature-deprived or larger-packaged products to act further as a segmentation hedge. 
At the retail level, EDLP store formats tend to forgo many of the sales and customer 
support activities that are available at other stores. They tend to be low-touch channels. By 
providing less in-store sales support, EDLP stores are able to reduce costs and earn a profi t 
at a lower price.
Some products should avoid EDLP channels and instead seek high-touch channels. Retail 
salespeople need not be simply clerks and shelf-stockers; they can be a strategic part of the 
marketing process. For instance, complex products—those whose features and attributes can-
not be summed up in a simple promotional statement—require salespeople to communicate 
and explain the benefi ts of competing offers. Likewise, products whose benefi ts are hard to 
predict prior to purchase, or whose benefi ts are not visually obvious, have improved sales 
through the interaction of salespeople with customers. Furthermore, salesperson interactions 
benefi t sales of products that require learning on behalf of customers. These include products 
that have a long time between purchases and are therefore diffi cult for customers to learn the 
differences and benefi ts of competing products, as well as complex products whose dimen-
sions of features and attributes evolve with time. Finally, high-priced products whose purchase 
represents a signifi cant portion of the customer’s spending money benefi t from salespeople 
interactions, due to the high risk of making a bad purchase decision.
Summary
• Price promotions are a form of price segmentation in which prices are reduced for 
those with a lower willingness to pay and regular prices are offered to those with a 
higher willingness to pay.
• Price promotions generate increased sales primarily through encouraging brand 
switching and secondarily through increasing the size of the market.
• From prospect theory, we understand that part of the power of price promotions to 
drive sales derives from consumers perceiving price reductions as a form of added 
gain on top of receiving the product, in exchange for the pain of payment. 
• Price promotions can have asymmetric effects on profi tability between competing 
fi rms where those products that are able to engender stronger brand loyalty are at 
a strategic advantage.
• The reference price effect, wherein customer price expectations are based on prior 
observed prices, can drive sales troughs following a price promotion and dampen 
the ability to raise prices thereafter.
• Deep and frequent price promotions can reduce price credibility, causing customers 
to stop believing that the full regular price is the appropriate price to pay.
• Because price promotions focus the customer’s attention on price, they can also 
increase price sensitivity.

• While a profi t sensitivity analysis to reveal volume hurdles can prevent the most 
egregious managerial errors with respect to price promotions, they fail to identify 
the more subtle challenges of “How many are too many?” and “How deep is 
too deep?” These questions suffer from the common philosophical challenge of 
vagueness. At some point, executives know that they have breached a limit, but it 
is diffi cult to identify which promotion crossed the line. To address this challenge, 
executives should conduct periodic reviews of the overall price promotion policy 
using more insightful qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques.
• In general, price promotions should strive to be targeted towards marginal 
customers. Other design criteria for price promotions include a desire for them to 
be temporary, special, and irregular. 
• Price promotions take many forms, including specially marked packages, coupons, 
trial offers, trade deals, promotional sales, discounts, promotional bundles, and 
rebates. Each format of a price promotion has its strengths and weaknesses in 
targeting specifi c types of customers and achieving different marketing objectives. 
• In contrast to Hi-Lo store formats, in which price promotions oscillate between 
high and low price levels, some retailers have executed an EDLP format, wherein 
everyday low prices are used. EDLP formats attract a higher proportion of customers 
with a lower willingness to pay, partially because their lower level of overall service 
discourages customers with a higher willingness to pay to patronize stores with such 
formats. To manage both Hi-Lo and EDLP retail channels, manufacturers often fi nd it 
benefi cial to market a feature-deprived or larger packaged version of their product in 
EDLP channels and full-feature, normal-size versions in Hi-Lo channels.

t has often been said that discount management is a game of improvement by inches 
that delivers miles of better performance. Many seemingly small decisions have incre-
mentally small effects on the fi rm’s performance, and yet the sum of these decisions can 
lead to overwhelmingly strong results. Because discounting decisions can either improve 
or harm profi ts, because they arise frequently and with great variety, and because they 
tend to suffer from the diffi culty of telling how much is too much, fi rms will often dedicate 
tremendous resources towards managing discount decisions.

Chapter 8 
Discount Management
An organizational challenge arises when you have to determine how discounting 
decisions should be managed and who should make discounting decisions. Discount 
management is a natural source of confl ict within any organization due to the differ-
ing objectives and beliefs that executives hold. To improve decision-making regarding 
discounting, fi rms have developed techniques for monitoring discounts, managing deci-
sions, and aligning organizational incentives. In this chapter, we begin by exploring the 
source of organizational confl ict with respect to discount management before turning to 
some of the systems and structures executives have developed as solutions for managing 
discount decisions.
Challenges in Discount Management Policy
Discounting decisions have challenged organizational cohesion and design for decades. 
One of the most common discount management challenges facing organizations is the 
disparity in incentives and knowledge between fi eld and centralized executives. 
FIELD EXECUTIVES PUSH FOR MORE DISCOUNTS
Salespeople and marketing communications executives in the fi eld are encouraged to pur-
sue market share. Their incentives, which take the form of bonuses and promotions as 
well as peer recognition, are often tied to their ability to increase sales volume and achieve 
targets. In fact, at one time it was common to set bonus structures for fi eld executives in 
direct proportion to the volume they sold; this practice still continues in some fi rms today. 
With these kinds of incentives, it is not uncommon for fi eld executives to move quickly 
toward discounts to achieve volume targets.
To meet lofty sales goals, fi eld executives are faced with some unpalatable options. They 
may undertake the herculean task of uncovering more sales opportunities and simultane-
ously communicate the value to prospects to increase the volume of units sold and capture 
better prices. Most fi rms hire fi eld executives to achieve precisely these goals. However, 
discounts can appear as a quicker and easier way to capture volume and at least deliver 
on some of these objectives. Moreover, the lofty sales goals given to fi eld executives are 
sometimes unrealistic in the absence of discounting. 
If sales require distributors, fi eld executives must increase the number of distribution 
sites and the willingness of those distribution outlets to support the product to meet their 
volume targets. Manufacturer-fi nanced price promotions and discounts are two tools 
that can help them achieve both greater distribution and stronger distribution support. In 
many situations, these tools are not just price concessions but necessary techniques to gain 
channel support and improve profi tability.
Especially in high-value single sales situations, the needs of an individual fi eld execu-
tive and those of the fi rm may be misaligned due to differences in risk bearing. When a 
salesperson faces the possibility of losing a valuable sale, the risk borne by the salesperson 
of losing that specifi c sale is greater than the risk borne by the fi rm, which typically man-
ages multiple sales opportunities at a time. The fi rm can diversify its sales risk by pursuing
multiple high-value single sales opportunities at a time. Salespeople at these fi rms often 
can do so only limitedly, if at all. Therefore, the salesperson may bear more risk than the 
fi rm with respect to a specifi c sales opportunity. To improve the probability of closing a 
single sales opportunity, it is not unnatural for the salesperson to feel a greater pressure 
than the fi rm to provide customers with price concessions. 
Given these incentives, a fi rm can fi nd itself in a disastrous situation if it abdicates 
all discounting authority to fi eld executives alone. Even in businesses where incentives
for fi eld executives are more in line with the organizational goals, there is still a need to 
manage discounting decisions to avoid abusive price concessions.

CENTRALIZED EXECUTIVES PUSH FOR HIGHER PRICES
At corporate headquarters, product managers and other centralized executives often 
focus on capturing the highest price possible while expecting the volume to simply be 
delivered. Incentives for these centralized executives, which take the form of compen-
sation, promotions, and peer respect, are often correlated with their ability to create 
products with a strong demand at a high price. After all, higher prices and larger mar-
ket projections are strategies that senior executives and investors are very likely to sup-
port. Lower-priced items and low–market penetration ideas are routinely met with little 
 interest. Given decision-making authority over strategic issues of product design and 
pricing, centralized executives may focus on marketing high-value products while hold-
ing expectations for fi eld executives to extract high prices from their customers. As such, 
discounts often contradict the basic decision paradigm to extract a high price from the 
market in every transaction.
From either economic value models, customer perception–based research, or econometric 
price optimization methods, executives will identify prices that are appropriate on average, 
but in some circumstances will be higher than the willingness of specifi c customers to pay. 
These methods of identifying the market’s willingness to pay often lump the entire market 
(or at least entire market segments) into a homogeneous group. However, price promotions 
and discounts may allow for fi ner market segmentation—market segmentation at a level 
that could not be predicted easily from a higher-level analysis, which in turn can account for 
disparity in willingness to pay between individual customers within the market. Centralized 
executives often lack the necessary tacit knowledge of the market required to make proper 
discounting decisions.
DISPARITY ABOUNDS
The disparity in incentives and knowledge between fi eld and centralized executives leads 
to a natural confl ict between them regarding discounts. Field executives will commonly 
call for greater discounts, while centralized executives will argue for fewer, if not zero, 
discounts. As we have seen, neither decision is optimal in all situations.
If discount decisions are yielded to fi eld executives alone, the fi rm can expect to fi nd 
a wide and growing disparity between list prices and actual selling prices. If all discount 
decisions are made centrally, the fi rm may be missing out on profi t-enhancing price 
s egmentation opportunities. Senior executives must narrow the disparity between these 
two outcomes to improve profi ts, but the path to narrowing this disparity requires the 
development of new organizational capabilities.
EXECUTIVES REACT
To halt the potential downward spiral in prices through discounting, some executives take 
a knee-jerk response and halt all discounts. Such a move is not only disruptive, it is also 
unprofi table. As has been discussed earlier, discounting is a form of price segmentation. 
If properly executed, price segmentation can improve profi ts. A profi t-maximizing fi rm 
should not necessarily seek to halt all discounts; rather, it should seek to ensure that the 
discounts granted are those that meet the design requirements of price-segmenting the 
market and improving profi tability. 
As an intermediate move, some senior executives have sought to remove all discount 
decision-making authority from the fi eld and manage it centrally. Unfortunately, even this 
intermediate move has often been found to be untenable for many fi rms. The productivity 
improvements created by reassigning decisions to those executives closest to the situation and 
possessing the most facts are real. In a large organization with hundreds of salespeople 
interacting with multiple channel partners or customers every day, senior executives

are unable to devote the necessary intellectual capacity to the hundreds of discounting
decisions that are made every day within the organization. Even if senior executives could 
spend the required time for every discounting decision, they would lack much of the
required implicit knowledge required to make the optimal decision—knowledge that is 
held by the fi eld executives and generated by their direct interaction with customers and 
channel partners. One of the key reasons to hire fi eld executives is to make fi eld decisions, 
including discounting decisions.
Discounting policy is naturally dispersed through various levels within an organiza-
tion precisely because different parts of the organization bring different insights into 
the decision-making challenge. Centralized senior executives bring value to discount 
 decision-making through their ability to aggregate multiple sources of data into a co-
hesive understanding. Meanwhile, decentralized fi eld executives bring value to decision-
making through uncovering specifi c facts and points of information regarding a particular
decision-making challenge. In setting discount policy, one of the goals is to combine the 
power of these disparate sources of value-added decision-making insights, centralized 
oversight and fi eld-gathered facts, to foster better decisions.
One might describe this as the challenge of marrying explicit knowledge to tacit knowl-
edge. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be codifi ed and transferred from one 
individual to another. It is knowledge that can be made explicit and be shared easily. Tacit 
or implicit knowledge is knowledge that is held by the knower and is diffi cult to trace to 
its source. With tacit knowledge, the knower is often unaware of the knowledge he or 
she possesses or how it can be valuable to others. Transferring tacit knowledge requires
extensive communication. The tacit aspects of knowledge are those that cannot be
codifi ed; they can be transmitted via training or gained through personal experience, but 
not easily by any other means. Transference of tacit knowledge involves learning and 
skills, but not in a way that can be written down effi ciently.
By interacting directly with customers or channel partners, fi eld executives hold tacit 
knowledge that is valuable in making decisions regarding discounts. At the same time, 
centralized executives use explicit knowledge to make decisions and support fi eld execu-
tives’ actions. To marry the tacit knowledge of fi eld executives to the explicit knowledge 
of centralized executives, many fi rms have adopted a common set of routines, analysis, 
and incentives to ensure that both fi eld executives and centralized managers are aligned in 
working towards a common goal. 
Identifying Discounting Management Opportunities
The three key analysis tools commonly used to measure, understand, and manage dis-
counts explicitly are the net price band, the relationship between net prices captured 
and market variables, and the price waterfall. The net price band enables executives 
to grasp the level of discounting within the fi rm quickly. The relationship between net 
prices captured and market variables enables executives to uncover potential drivers to 
discounting, some of which may refl ect competitive pressures while others may refl ect 
opportunities for improved management. The price waterfall enables executives to iden-
tify the magnitude of the impact of specifi c types of discounts and potentially uncover 
a means of reshaping discounts to improve their profi t impact. Combined, these three 
discount- monitoring tools provide a high-level aggregated picture of the fi rm’s discount-
ing practices that enables a quick executive review of price discounting and the potential 
for improving profi tability. 
The net price band, price to market variable, and price waterfall discount-monitoring 
tools have been developed mostly within industrial markets due to the unique nature of 
customer transactions and the magnitude of discounting within these industries. However,

to illustrate the power of these monitoring tools for informing discount decisions, we will 
use a hypothetical fi rm working in a consumer market, because most readers are more 
aware of the specifi cs of consumer markets than industrial markets. SoftCo is a represen-
tative example of a consumer software product fi rm that distributes its products through 
consumer retail channels. While the specifi cs of this example are unique to consumer 
software fi rms, the overall approach described here can be used in any market. Consumer 
and business markets, tangible and intangible products, and products ranging from com-
modity to differentiated to niche all benefi t from the application of these three analytical 
monitoring tools.
NET PRICE BAND 
One of the most basic analytical tools for developing a high-level understanding of dis-
counts is identifying the net price and plotting the net price band.1 The net price is the 
actual price paid by customers after accounting for all forms of discounts, including on-
invoice and off-invoice discounts. Firms use the net price rather than the average selling 
price as some forms of discounts are made obvious to customers by placing them on the 
invoice itself, whereas other forms of discounts are not necessarily on the invoice itself. 
Off-invoice discounts affect the actual transaction price, but are not on the invoice at 
the time of sale for various reasons. For instance, channel performance rebates may reduce 
the total invoice on future invoices but will not appear at the time of sale. Other items re-
lated to shifting costs from the buyer to the seller can also be conceptualized as discounts, 
and thus would reduce the net price paid by the customer. See Exhibit 8-1 for an example 
list of discount forms and their positions as “on-” or “off-invoice”.)
The strategic informational value of net price band plots is in uncovering price hetero-
geneity and identifying unprofi table transactions. Some of the difference in net price paid 
may be driven by a true underlying form of market heterogeneity, or differences in will-
ingness to pay between customers. In this case, a net price band plot can signal to senior 
executives the potential to identify which customers are more profi table, the opportunity 
to encourage behavioral changes among less-profi table customers, or the potential need to 
redirect chronically unprofi table customers. Unprofi table transactions identifi ed from the 
net price band signal the need to make determinations to either eliminate or reduce such 
transactions.
For example, SoftCo’s consumer product has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price 
(MSRP) of $39.99. In selling through various retail channels, SoftCo offers a variety of 
discounting mechanisms, where the largest one accounts for retailer margin. Yet even after 
accounting for retailer margin, the net price captured by SoftCo varies from transaction to 
transaction. To show how the net price varies, we construct a net price band, a bar-plot of 
the volume of units sold within a specifi c price band. See Exhibit 8-2.
From the net price band, SoftCo discovers that there is signifi cant variance in the mag-
nitude of discounts within the market. Some of this variance can be properly attributed 
to price segmentation techniques that capture marginal customers and improve marginal 
profi ts, while other portions may be due to improper discounting practices. Before we 
detect the drivers of the price variance, let us fi rst examine how the net price band alone 
informs decisions. 
Variations in net price between different transactions are not uncommon; indeed, 
they are the norm. Moreover, observed variations in net price tend to be quite wide. For 
instance, in consumer products, a lighting fi xture manufacturer observed a variance in 
net price of 60 percent and a computer peripherals supplier observed a variance in net 
price of 70 percent. In business products, a specialty chemical fi rm observed a variance 
in net price of 200 percent and a fastener supplier observed a variance in net price of 
500 percent.

Chapter 8 
Discount Management
Some of the variance in net price paid is due to true underlying differences in the abil-
ity to capture higher prices within the market arising from a variation between customers 
or market segments. For example, fi rms regularly take on low-margin business to sat-
isfy certain large-volume customers who improve capacity utilization, while also serving
numerous low-volume customers who purchase at a higher net price. Examining net price 
by market variables may uncover strategic insights into which customer segments are truly 
more profi table and which are not.
If the variable cost to produce SoftCo’s product was $14, SoftCo would identify quickly 
from the net price band that roughly 5 percent of the units sold were actually unprofi table. In 
this case, SoftCo can take steps to eliminate these transactions immediately, either by correct-
ing poor discounting decisions or by requiring those customers to pay a higher price.
A wide net price band informs executives of opportunities for improvement. Dropping 
a few sales in the lowest net price band and adding a few in the highest net price band

can improve profi tability dramatically. To do this, fi rms can seek to move customers to the 
more appropriate and profi table discount levels while also acquiring new customers who 
fi t the profi le of those most likely to pay a higher price.
NET PRICE BY MARKET VARIABLE
If the net price band is wide and executives conclude that there is suffi cient room for
improvement, their next step is typically to examine the net price paid by certain market 
segments. This is the net price by market variable. This approach enables senior executives 
to identify quickly whether there is slack in sales management and potential to improve
discounting practices within the fi rm or if there are true differences between market segments.
Differences in net price paid are often driven by some underlying segmentation vari-
able within the market.2 Examining the net price paid by various market segmenta-
tion variables may uncover the driver of price variations. Alternatively, examining the 
net price paid by sales territory may identify specifi c salespeople who may require bet-
ter training and oversight when it comes to discounting, or it may reveal the potential
to transfer best practices between sales leaders and sales followers so that the fi rm can 
capture higher prices.
Returning to the example of SoftCo, senior executives suspected that price variances 
may be related to volume discounts. To examine this suspicion, they plotted net prices 
against volume sold to various channels. The plot appears in Exhibit 8-3. If net prices 
had been related to sales volume, the scatter plot would demonstrate an overall down-
ward trend where higher volumes would be related to lower prices. For SoftCo, this trend 
was unobserved. Higher-level statistical analysis may reveal a relationship between sales 
volume and net price, but the plot alone yielded suffi cient evidence for the management 
of SoftCo that the valuable source of price variances may be another driver. 
Another suspected driver of price variation was the region served. To examine this 
factor, net prices were plotted according to the market region. See Exhibit 8-4. The large

diamonds identify the average net price in various regions, while the upper and lower 
bars identify the range of prices within that region. From this plot, executives are able to 
determine quickly that the Northeast region was facing signifi cantly greater discounting 
challenges than all other regions, thus deserving greater managerial attention. 
Similar to the plots of net price to volume or net price to market regions, executives 
can examine other potential sources of price variances and market heterogeneity. For in-
stance, if shipping is a typical negotiation point or cost issue, executives may fi nd value 
in examining net prices against distance shipped, similar to that of net price to volume, to 
uncover the seriousness of the issue. Alternatively, if competitive presence, sales territory, 
channel type, or other categorical issues may be considered as a driver of price differences, 
plots similar to that of net price to market region can be used to identify categorical issues 
that drive price variances. Executives may fi nd it necessary to examine several different 
variables prior to identifying the specifi c issues that correlate with net prices. Statistical 
analysis will aid this process.

PRICE WATERFALL
The third means of aggregating data concerning discounting for senior executive review is 
the price waterfall. As stated, the net price band identifi es the size of the opportunity for 
improving discount practices. Once the opportunity has been identifi ed, the more strate-
gic area for improving discount practices is in identifying market segmentation variables 
that lead to different discounting phenomena. These segmentation variables can be used 
to direct market development investments and other efforts to capture more sales from 
the more profi table segments of the market. Net price by market variable analysis is typi-
cally useful in this endeavor. The third method, price waterfalls, takes a more intensive 
approach to improving net prices. Price waterfalls enable senior executives to uncover 
relationships between the form of the price discount and customer price sensitivity.
Price waterfalls identify the discounts provided and their effects on the differences be-
tween the internal reference price and the net price. The internal reference price may be the 
MSRP, the list price, or some other form of base price from which all discounts are granted. 
Price waterfalls plot the type of discount given, the timing of that discount, and the size of 
those discounts. They include both on-invoice and off-invoice discount types, and provide a 
holistic view into the impact and types of different discounts. See Exhibit 8-5 for an example 
using the SoftCo scenario.

Discount Management
Price waterfalls are useful for two reasons. First, they highlight the types of discounts 
that the fi rm provides and their impact on actual net prices, and therefore profi tability. 
Second, they create a model for exploring potential means of reducing discounts without 
affecting profi ts, and perhaps even of improving net volumes.
For instance, brand manufacturers operating in retail markets often give both trade
allowances and promotional allowances, perhaps in the form of cooperative advertising 
or in-store displays. Branded manufacturers may fi nd that sales at the retail level are more 
sensitive to the dollars spent on in-store displays than on cooperative advertising. As such, 
executives may determine that it is in their best interest to shift discount dollars out of the 
budget for cooperative advertising and increase discount allowances for in-store displays. 
The effect is of shaping the price waterfalls.
Shaping the price waterfalls is a technique designed to shift discounts into areas where 
they deliver greater improvements in volume and reduce discounts from the types that have 
little impact on sales. Firms often fi nd that sales volumes to different customers or through 
channels are sensitive to different types of discounts. The price waterfall enables senior ex-
ecutives to review quickly the discounts provided and their effectiveness, and to test different 
hypotheses regarding discount structures to identify the most profi table discounting policy. 
Each discount identifi ed in a price waterfall represents an opportunity for potential 
improvement. The market may be more sensitive to some forms of discounts than others. 
As such, the fi rm profi ts by shifting discounts out of forms that the market is less sensi-
tive, and into areas where they have a greater impact. Similarly, the fi rm may fi nd that it is 
offering some forms of discount to a greater or lesser degree than its competitors. Again, 
when such an area is identifi ed, executives can determine the impact of those discounts 
and the need to bring their discount policy closer to the industry norm or improve their 
discounting policy compared to the industry average.
Discount Decision Management
For managing specifi c discount decisions, organizations have come to rely on two key 
approaches to ensure that decisions are made with the best interests of the fi rm at heart. 
These are limitations on decision-making authority and the alignment of incentives. 
While we have explored the value of discounting, the means of monitoring discount-
ing, and the approaches to improving discounting policy, fi rms still must face the fact 
that discount decisions are made by humans within their organizations. Furthermore, 
for reasons of organizational effi ciency and the value of using tacit knowledge gained by 
fi eld executives, senior executives know that many of these discounting decisions must 
be made in the fi eld.
As an area of pricing, no specifi c issue is likely to create more tension between different 
departments and require more ongoing management involvement than those related to dis-
counts. While the tension cannot be eliminated (indeed, some research has shown that this 
tension is necessary for a healthy and profi table organization), it does need to be managed.3
Many of the tools for managing discount decisions have been discussed previously. The 
basic-level analysis regarding discount decisions requires volume hurdles. Volume hurdles 
identifi ed from a profi t sensitivity analysis can be used to evaluate whether the discount 
and marginal sales that it creates are profi t-improving or profi t-damaging. When the pro-
jected volume increase created by a discount fails to meet the volume hurdle, most execu-
tives will agree to end the discussion at that point. For further analysis, fi rms can examine 
a discount with regard to the value of the sales at risk and the likelihood that the price 
v ariance granted will capture those sales. 
As has been discussed, discounts that are targeted at price-sensitive customers and
enable price segmentation can improve profi ts. In general, the more that a discount affects

a specifi c objective, and the higher the value of meeting that objective, the more valuable 
that discount becomes to the fi rm. Sometimes, this rule even overrides the restrictions on 
discounts uncovered through a profi t sensitivity analysis. 
These guidelines regarding discounts and other forms of price variances are useful for 
informing decisions, but these guidelines alone do not ensure that individual managers 
make good discounting decisions. Discount decisions, as discussed, are naturally dispersed 
within the organization. Many independent executives contribute to discount decisions 
every day. Organizations need more than guidelines to manage these independent decisions; 
they need decision management systems.
To improve independent decision-making regarding discounts, organizations use a 
management framework. Two key approaches have been pursued to improve the decision 
management framework. The fi rst is to restrict decision-making rights within the orga-
nization, assigning the responsibility for decisions that might have the highest impact to 
executives with the greatest oversight. The second is to restructure incentives to encourage 
better alignment between the motivations that infl uence fi eld management decisions and 
the organization’s goals. 
DECISION RIGHTS
As a fi rst line of defense against abusive discounting, organizations will limit decision-
making rights within the organization. Individual salespeople may be granted limited dis-
cretion over discounting. Discount requests greater than that which individual executives 
are allowed to grant are then referred to higher-level managers for their approval or rejec-
tion. In this manner, discount decisions are escalated up through the organization as their 
impact increases.
For instance, specifi c salespeople may be given authority to grant combined discounts 
up to 2.5 percent. Beyond 2.5 percent, salespeople must request authorization for the dis-
count from their territory manager. Territory managers may also face some limitations on 
their decision-making authority, perhaps driving all discounts that result in a 5 percent or 
greater net price variance to be referred to sales executive managers for review. For dis-
counts beyond 9 percent, sales executive managers must confer with their chief executive 
offi cer (CEO). The CEO retains authority for any discounts greater than 9 percent. In this 
manner, discount decisions are escalated up the organization as the depth of the discount 
increases. Actual cutoff points are specifi c to the fi rm and vary between industries.
Other forms of limiting discount decision-making authority and escalating discount 
decisions are common. Some fi rms fi nd it more useful to include limitations on discounts 
based on dollar amounts. Small total dollar discounts are left up to the discretion of 
lower-level managers, while larger total dollar amount discounts require approval by 
senior executives. Discount decisions can also be restricted according to type, such as 
allowing larger discounts when related to market development funds and smaller dis-
counts when related to cash payments, freight, and other accounting or operational 
functions. Alternatively, discount decision-making rights may be related to discount pur-
poses where certain market segments are deemed of greater strategic importance to the 
fi rm than others and the organization seeks to fast-track decisions related to specifi c 
strategic initiatives. 
DECISION INCENTIVES 
A supplementary means of improving decision-making within the organization is through 
improving the alignment of the incentives facing decision makers and the goals of the 
organization. This implies that the fi nancial incentive structure, or more specifi cally the 
compensation package offered to individuals with discount authority, is structured to
address certain decision biases that those individuals may hold.

Chapter 8 
Discount Management
Organizations typically aim for long-term fi nancial health, but fi eld executives typically 
are rewarded for short-term fi nancial performance. In the face of the short-term fi nancial 
rewards for individual salespeople, they may be encouraged to grant discounts more freely 
than would be most benefi cial to the fi rm so that they meet their short-term sales objec-
tives. Many organizations have changed a portion of the fi nancial incentives of salespeople 
to address the time-orientation differences between the salespeople and the organization 
as a whole.
Within the sales compensation package, there are often several factors. Salespeople 
often earn a base salary or draw against future earnings to ensure some fi nancial stability 
throughout the natural volatility in closing sales opportunities. On top of this base earning 
potential, salespeople typically face highly leveraged earnings, where bonuses and com-
missions are set in proportion to performance. Some of these performance incentives may 
be set according to behavioral objectives, such as teamwork or compliance with broader 
corporate goals, but most performance incentives are based on sales.
The sales performance portion of the incentive package for salespeople has undergone 
many improvements over the years. The dominant orientations have been to provide per-
formance incentives based on volume, revenue, or profi ts. 
Volume-based performance objectives are used in some industries; however, they fail 
to provide any incentive to reduce discounts. If salespeople have no discounting author-
ity, volume-based performance incentives are not necessarily bad. However, most indus-
tries grant salespeople some discretion over discounting. In these industries, volume-based 
performance incentives are misaligned with any corporate objectives in capturing higher 
prices and minimizing discounts.
Revenue-based performance incentives represent a better alignment between the de-
sires of salespeople and those of the organization. With revenue-based incentives, a discount
lowers the revenue earned and thus decreases the monetary compensation for the individual 
salesperson while also decreasing the revenue of the fi rm. However, we have seen that a 
30 percent decrease in price affects the profi tability of the fi rm far more than 30 percent, 
perhaps even making the sale totally unprofi table. Meanwhile, when performance incen-
tives are based on revenue, a 30 percent decrease in price can decrease the salesperson’s 
compensation by only 30 percent, and it will decrease the compensation by less than
30 percent if he or she also earns a base salary. Given the choice of angering a customer 
by saying “no” to a discount request or pestering the fi rm for a discount on behalf of 
the customer, salespeople whose income is based on revenue will often choose the latter.
Even revenue-based performance incentives are insuffi cient to align the goals of individual 
salespeople properly with those of the fi rm.4
The third approach has been to tie performance incentives to profi ts.5 Alternatively 
named profi t- or kicker-based commissions, performance incentives tied to profi ts increase 
when net prices are above targets, and they decrease when they fall below targets. In 
their most aggressive forms, profi t-based commissions actually increase and decrease sales 
compensation more than they do individual sales profi tability. An example formula for 
calculating the profi t-based commission is provided in Equation 8.1:
Sales Credit 5 [Target Price 2 k (Target Price 2 Actual Price)] ? Units Sold 
 
Eq. 8.1
The kicker, k in Equation 8.1, is a factor greater than or equal to 1 divided by the per-
centage contribution margin at the target price. For instance, if the contribution margin 
at the target price is 25 percent, the kicker should be 4 or higher. With a kicker of 4, a
10 percent discount reduces the sales credit by 40 percent, rather than 10 percent. This 
is in line with the effect of a discount on the profi tability of the fi rm. Because salespeople 
often take a shorter-term view of the fi rm than do management (they can always move

on), some authors suggest raising the kicker even higher than 1 over the target contribu-
tion margin to bring their incentives more in line with the corporate goals.
Tying sales incentives to profi ts and using kicker-based commissions is not for the faint-
hearted. Even though the shift from revenue-based incentives to profi t-based incentives 
can be structured such that the change in the sales commission structure leaves the average 
salesperson unaffected while further rewarding the best salespeople and strongly encour-
aging behavioral changes among the worst, fi rms that make this change face multiple dis-
ruptions. Many executives who have adapted profi t-based commissions found that most 
salespeople embrace the change, stay, and thrive, some are more lukewarm and adjust 
with time, and a minority move on to new positions. Departure rates as high as 30 percent 
have been reported anecdotally.
On the positive side, executives that have changed to profi t-based performance incentives 
have also reported a change in the behavior of their salespeople. Specifi cally, salespeople 
have been observed to shift their requests from discounts to requests for further marketing 
support. These newly rejuvenated salespeople are often found hunting for further evidence 
to justify a higher price or asking for and creating other value-based sales messages. This 
will shift the pressure point from being between salespeople and price managers to being 
between sales and marketing communications or sales and product management.
Summary
• Discount management consumes tremendous organizational resources due to the 
frequency and variety of discounting. Furthermore, the fundamental vagueness 
of fi guring out how much discounting is too much makes discounting decisions 
challenging. 
• Natural tension arises within an organization around discount management 
due to confl icting sources of organizational productivity. The value of increased 
productivity by pushing discounting questions further down into the organization 
confl icts with the value of closely managing price variances. The value of exploiting 
tacit knowledge held by fi eld managers confl icts with general beliefs developed 
from explicit knowledge held by senior executives. 
• Aggravating the challenges in discount management are confl icting incentives 
between short-term sales objectives and long-term strategic objectives, and confl icting 
risk profi les between fi eld executives charged with specifi c sales opportunities and 
senior executives managing a wider portfolio of sales opportunities. 
• While knee-jerk reactions to excessive price discounting that end up prohibiting all 
discounts may halt the increasing disparity between prices set at the strategic level 
and those tactically used in the market, they may also damage profi tability due to the 
value of using price discounts in price segmentation and capturing marginal sales.
• The three key approaches to monitoring discount practices are net price bands, net 
price by market variable, and price waterfalls.
• Net price is the actual price paid by customers after all forms of discounts have 
been accounted for, including both on-invoice and off-invoice discounts. Net price 
bands highlight the heterogeneity in effective price paid and potentially identify 
unprofi table transactions for elimination. High levels of heterogeneity in net price 
paid indicate the possibility of improving profi tability by decreasing the unit sales 
with lower profi tability and increasing unit sales with higher profi tability.
• Plots of net price against market variables enable senior executives to uncover drivers 
of net price heterogeneity. These drivers can be used to identify market segments or 
practices that are more profi table as opposed to those that are less profi table.

Discount Management
• Price waterfalls enable senior executives to uncover relationships between the form 
of the price discount and customer price sensitivity. They identify the size and type 
of discounts used and their effect on net price paid.
• From an organizational viewpoint, two key approaches for price discount 
management are limiting decision-making rights and altering decision incentives.
• In price discounting decisions, best practices assign different depths or types of 
discounts to different levels within the organization. Those seeking discounts 
beyond their decision-making rights must escalate the decision up the organization.
• Improvements to incentives regarding discount decisions have focused on shifting 
performance-based incentives from volume to revenue, and from revenue to profi ts. 
Shifting performance-based incentives to transactional profi ts has proved daunting 
for many organizations.
Exercises
 1. Real-estate agents typically work on pure commission. A study found that agents 
tend to keep their own homes on the market for an average of ten additional days 
and sell it for more than 3 percent more than a client’s home.6

real-estate agent? 
 b. Is the fi nancial incentive of a real estate agent aligned with a homeowner?
 2. Discussion question: What is the difference between explicit knowledge and 
implicit knowledge? Should all discounting rules be strictly enforced? How should 
a fi rm manage exceptions?
 3. How can heterogeneity in willingness to pay be revealed through a net price band? 
 4. A maker of silicones conducts a net price by market variable investigation and 
discovers that prices tend to be lower for customers who have little need for service 
and tend to buy in bulk. Executives consider two options: reducing marketing 
oriented towards low-service, bulk purchasers of silicone or creating a new offering 
targeting low-service, bulk purchasers at a lower price point. Which approach 
would you support and why?
 5. A manufactured-good fi rm fi nds that its market share has been slipping in a 
geographic market. It chooses to conduct a benchmarking study of its price waterfall 
against the industry standard and discovers that the standard trade discount to 
retailers by competitors in that geographic market is somewhat higher than the 
fi rm’s, while the cooperative advertising budget of competitors in that geographic 
market is somewhat lower than the fi rm’s. What action would you suggest and why?
 6. A plumbing fi xture fi rm fi nds that its market share has been growing. It chooses to 
conduct a benchmarking study of its price waterfall against the industry standard 
and discover that its quarterly bonus is higher than the industry average, while its

industry average. What action would you suggest and why?
 7. Consider the following fi rms and the salesperson incentive structure: a fi rm selling knives 
door to door at a set customer price; a fi rm selling jet engines to airlines at a negotiated 
price that is reviewed by many executives; and a fi rm selling cake mix to bakers and 
grocers where deals are made by individual salespeople. Which fi rm might fi nd volume-
based incentives most appropriate? Which fi rm might fi nd revenue-based incentives most 
appropriate? Which fi rm might fi nd profi t-based incentives most appropriate? Are profi t-
based incentives always the most effi cient? Why might a fi rm choose not to use them?

he price structure is the architecture around which the fi rm’s pricing mix is de-

discounting, which change the price from the fi rm’s reference price, the price struc-
ture adjusts the fi rm’s reference price. In this and the coming chapters, we will explore 
some of the price structures that have the greatest impact in detail.2

Price Structures and Multipart Pricing
on a sale-by-sale basis, they are easy to implement but are not necessarily the easiest to 
optimize and manage. Price promotions and discounts, while very common, are only one 
method of price segmentation. The alternative method to price-segment the market is 
through the price structure itself.
By comparison, price structures are a strategic means to price-segment the market. The 
price structure defi nes the price extracted from different market segments. It will adjust auto-
matically the invoice price of all transactions, not simply promotional or specifi c sales situa-
tions. Executives can structure prices such that the total price paid will be proportional to a 
customer segment’s willingness to pay. Price structures are a strategic pricing policy choice.
Price Structures
The price structure defi nes the method by which total transaction prices are determined. 
For instance, the price structure of a typical residential utility bill includes multiple items 
that add up to form the total transaction charge. On a monthly basis, some of the items 
are constant, while other items vary with the amount of service delivered. Combined, these 
items in this utility bill form what is known as multipart pricing. 
Price structures are a more steadfast component of pricing than price levels and promo-
tions. Once established, price structures quickly become the industry norm against which 
competing alternatives are compared and market segments are defi ned. Changing price 
structures requires redefi ning the decision criteria for customers to select between prod-
ucts and redefi ning the market segments themselves. It is far more diffi cult to change price 
structures than to change individual prices. Both list prices and promotional prices can 
be changed relatively quickly, but changing price structures implies changing the industry 
dynamics itself.
Because changing industry dynamics is such a powerful strategic tool, price structures 
are a critical strategic weapon. New entrants will explore new price structures as a po-
tential means of displacing industry incumbents. For example, consider Skype’s prepaid 
per-minute price structure compared to telecom industry incumbents using postpaid, set 
fees for local phone calls; Southwest’s initial pricing of individual legs on trips in compari-
son to airline industry incumbents pricing roundtrips; or Zipcar’s membership fee plus an 
hourly usage fee for cars compared to incumbents in the rental car industry pricing for 
entire days only. Each of these fi rms sought to redefi ne the price point for customers to 
enter the market and did so by redefi ning the price structure.
RETHINKING THE UNIT
At fi rst blush, the issue of what is priced appears mundane. Firms produce or distribute 
goods and services, and they price them. When executives take this approach to  pricing, 
they are effectively establishing unit pricing as the price structure, and the metric that 
 determines the total price paid is the units sold. With unit pricing, the interplay between 
the overall market demand curve and marginal costs determines the optimal price to 
charge. However, the issue of what should be priced is a bit more complex.
For examples of different price structures, consider how a bill is determined in different 
industries. Construction, consulting, and legal fi rms have each used billable-hour pricing 
and are venturing into completed-project pricing. Alternatively, consider the price struc-
tures at dining establishments, where some restaurants use buffet or all-you-can eat pricing, 
others use fi xed prices for entire meals, and still others charge for specifi c items. Even butter 
can have an itemized price in some restaurants. When a fi rm considers a different way of 
calculating the transaction price, it is considering a different price structure.
We know that different customers have different willingness to pay. Willingness to pay 
is not necessarily derived from the unit that is being sold, but from the desired benefi t of

the product or service. The benefi ts of a product themselves depend upon the goal that the 
customer is seeking to accomplish and the importance of that product in contributing to 
goal accomplishment. Different customers have different goals and seek different benefi ts 
from a product, and therefore they will have different willingness to pay for that product. 
By uncovering drivers related to their heterogeneity in willingness to pay, executives can 
go beyond simple unit pricing. They can structure their pricing such that prices vary in 
proportion to the driver of the willingness to pay.
The identity of a price structure is defi ned by the basic metric that it uses to defi ne the 
price. While it may be most natural to defi ne the priced unit according to a number of 
goods sold or hours worked, other arrangements that are less internal-accounting in origin 
and more customer-centric in viewpoint are possible. Moreover, customer-centric pric-
ing is more profi table in most markets. In a customer-focused price structure, prices are 
associated with the benefi ts that customers derive from the product rather than units of 
consumption. When the basis for pricing is shifted from units sold to goals accomplished, 
the fi rm has restructured its prices to focus on the customer.
In defi ning the price structure, two key questions to address are (1) What drives the 
value that customers place on the offering? (2) How can the fi rm capture prices in pro-
portion to the value that customers perceive? By raising these questions, executives can 
uncover a metric for pricing beyond the units sold and toward the value delivered. 
USING DEMAND HETEROGENEITY 
Each of the fundamental approaches to setting prices focused on pricing in proportion to 
the value that customers place on the product. Often, customers don’t value the product as 
much as they value what the product enables them to do. For some customers, the product 
is the focal instrument for enabling the accomplishment of a valuable goal. For others, the 
product is one of many options that enable a marginally important goal. Pricing in pro-
portion to the value that customers place on the outcomes they can achieve with a product 
can enable the fi rm to capture much higher value. Yet the challenge that a fi rm faces is in 
fi nding a means to capture a price in proportion to the utility that the product enables. 
Properly identifying the unit of measurement with which to associate a price enables fi rms 
to align their price capture to the driver of value from the customer’s perspective. 
Demand heterogeneity refers to the manner in which different customers are willing to 
pay different amounts in different purchasing situations. Demand heterogeneity can derive 
from differences between customers, or differences within a single customer’s willingness 
to pay depending upon the situation, timing, urgency, or a host of other factors. Pricing 
structures that match demand heterogeneity will improve profi ts.
In designing the price structure to price-segment the market, the overarching goal is to 
set the price that different customers pay for the product equal to their specifi c willingness 
to pay (so long as it is above marginal costs). Hence, demand heterogeneity informs price 
heterogeneity. Demand heterogeneity is both a driver of price structure selection and a 
limitation of the effectiveness of different price structures.
For instance, a tradesperson will place a higher value on a cordless drill than a home-
maker, and neither values the drill as much as they value the ability to make holes and 
fasten screws. While a fi rm may like to price in proportion to the value of drilling holes, the 
competitive and substitute forces make pricing-by-the-hole untenable. As such, toolmakers 
must sell tools instead of holes; but they do not have to sell just one type of tool, nor do 
they have to use just one price. The tool manufacturer can sell trade tools at a different 
price than they sell homemaker tools, and at least partially capture prices in proportion 
to the driver of value from each customer’s perspective. Redefi ning the unit, as in creating 
different products for different market segments by the tool manufacturer, is a method 
of addressing the disparity in variation in utility that customers derive from the product.

Price Structures and Multipart Pricing
Redefi ning the unit to align with demand heterogeneity can come in many forms. One 
method is to change the unit from that of the sale of a product to that of the ability to use 
a product. Rental agreements and subscription-based services redefi ne the unit away from 
the units of product sold to units of agreement sold that enable customers to use a product. 
From housing to insurance, and even software as a service, redefi ning the unit into a leased 
or subscription-based offering has been observed.
Another method of redefi ning the unit can come in the form of multipart pricing. Mul-
tipart pricing is a powerful approach for increasing the profi tability of a fi rm. In it, the 
transaction price is calculated from using two or more metrics rather than just one. For 
instance, Zipcar sells drivers a contract that grants the right to use its cars and charges a 
per-hour fee for actually driving their cars. In this way, the Zipcar is both pricing the value 
that customers have on having access to cars and on using cars.
Other methods of redefi ning the unit may focus more on actually changing the prod-
uct sold. Add-ons, versions, and bundles are all means of redefi ning the product sold 
to deliver value in closer proportion to the value sought, and also of enabling the fi rm 
to capture greater value in the process. From software to home appliances and even 
automobiles, add-on sales, product versioning, and bundling have each found a role in 
improving profi ts. Returning to our example of cordless drills, tool manufacturers make 
models specifi cally designed for the professional market separate from those for house-
hold use. There are still other means to redefi ne the unit that improve profi ts. In yield 
management, the metric changes from the simple product to a combination of the prod-
uct and the timing of the product purchase. Airlines and hotels have found yield manage-
ment to be a powerful profi t tool.
Price structures that mirror the perception of value tend to be more profi table than 
those that mirror variable costs. They do so by simultaneously extracting higher prices 
from customers who value the product more, while charging lower prices to a larger 
market segment that values the product less. Because the price structure and market seg-
mentation are connected so closely, executives must make careful tradeoffs when selecting 
a price structure. Different price structures segment the market differently. Some are more 
effective in certain situations, while in other situations a different price structure is re-
quired. In the coming chapters, we will look at a variety of price structures, provide some 
insight into the power and pitfalls of these methods, and demonstrate their value through 
economic models. 
Multipart Price Structures
TWO-PART TARIFFS 
The most common economic example of a price structure beyond unit pricing is called a 
two-part tariff. Two-part tariffs have two elements in the pricing. The fi rst element can be 
likened to an entrance fee. The entrance fee is a fi xed sum charged to all customers regard-
less of their level of consumption. The second element is a per-use level of consumption or 
some other form of a metered fee. The metered fee is determined through some measure-
ment of the units consumed. In one description of a two-part tariff, one would state that 
the entrance fee provides the privilege of purchasing the metered component.
In an idealized profi t-maximization format, the fi rst element is priced to extract all 
value from customers, while the second element is priced to recapture marginal costs. 
Such a format is possible if the market is homogeneous. When all customers have similar 
demand, the optimal structure in a two-part tariff is to set the entrance equal to the value 
that customers gain from consuming the product while setting the metered fee equal to 
marginal costs. The optimal entrance fee in homogeneous markets will transfer all the 
value created and delivered to customers to the fi rm in the form of profi ts.3

In more realistic implementations, both elements extract value from customers in pro-
portion to their willingness to pay. In fact, the metered fee provides the dominant source 
of profi ts for the fi rm in many implementations of two-part tariffs. If the market is het-
erogeneous, the optimal structure of a two-part tariff will require both parts of the price 
structure to generate profi ts. In a heterogeneous market, the two-part tariff can transfer 
the value derived by customers to the fi rm only from the customers with the least demand. 
For all other customers, the value created and delivered by the fi rm is shared by both the 
customers and the fi rm. Because most every realistic market is heterogeneous, two-part 
tariffs will generally rely on earning profi ts from both the entrance and metered portions.
From a customer perspective, two-part tariffs charge different prices to customers in 
proportion to consumption. For low-consuming customers, the total price calculated from 
a two-part tariff is small; for a high-consuming customer, the total price is large.
Two-part tariffs require products that cannot be easily resold or stored for later use. 
This requirement stems from the need to prevent aftermarket transfer. In general, the abil-
ity of a fi rm to implement a two-part tariff decreases with competition. As competition 
increases, fi rms fi nd their ability to charge an entrance fee decreases, and they must raise 
the price of the metered component within their price structure. 
TYING ARRANGEMENTS
Very similar in structure to a two-part tariff is a tying arrangement. Like a two-part tariff, 
tying arrangements use two prices for selling multiple products that function together to 
deliver value to customers. Unlike two-part tariffs, the price structure in a tying arrange-
ment is designed to create profi ts primarily through the sale of the second good, not the 
fi rst good. 
In a tying arrangement, the fi rm will sell two related products that function together to 
deliver value to a customer. Customers may be able to derive some value from the prod-
ucts independently, but most of the value that a customer derives is from the joint use of 
the two products. 
In a classic deployment of a tying arrangement, the fi rst product is a durable good and 
the second product is a consumable good that is used in conjunction with the durable 
good. For example, consider razor handles and razor blades. Razors are commonly sold 
with an introductory package that includes both the handle and the blades. Once the cus-
tomer consumes the initial set of blades, further blades are purchased that are designed 
to be used with specifi c handles. If customers want to use a competitor’s blades with their 
initial handle, they will fi nd that the competitor’s blades do not fi t. By designing the razor 
handle and blades to fi t each other specifi cally and not fi t a competitor’s handle or blade, 
the fi rm has tied the initial sale of the handle to all future sales of blades.
From a profi t-capturing perspective, tying arrangements are the polar opposite of two-
part tariffs. In a two-part tariff, fi rms will price the entrance fee relatively high to contrib-
ute a majority of the profi ts while pricing the metered unit relatively low to contribute only 
a fraction of the fi rm’s profi ts. In a tying arrangement, the fi rst product, which is also the 
durable portion of the sale, is priced relatively low, if not below marginal costs, and will 
deliver only a small fraction of the fi rm’s profi ts, if any. Meanwhile, the second product, 
or the consumable portion of the sale, is priced relatively high, and its sales will deliver a 
 majority of the fi rm’s profi ts, if not all of them. In many tying arrangments, the profi ts from 
the consumable portion of the sale are used to subsidize the losses from the durable 
 portion of the sale. 
Firms are driven from two-part tariffs towards tying arrangements through the forces of 
competition.4 Two-part tariff price structures are common in industries where fi rms have 
a monopoly position over their product, if not at least limited competition. In  markets 
where tying arrangements are common, fi rms compete with one another to bring customers

into a long-term relationship in which profi ts are made through repeat purchases. By 
 pricing the durable product low in a tying arrangement to solidify a lasting customer-fi rm 
relationship, the fi rm can capture more customers. Once customers are captured, they 
tend to continue their relationship with their chosen supplier because of the durable good. 
As such, the fi rm profi ts by selling the subsequent consumable products at a relatively 
high margin. 
For tying arrangements to be profi table, customers must maintain their relationship 
with the fi rm. Profi ts are created through the sale of the consumable portion of the tying 
arrangement, not the sale of the durable portion. Repeat customers who return to the fi rm 
to purchase the consumable portion of the tying arrangement are those who contribute 
the highest portion of the fi rm’s profi ts in the long run. One-time customers who purchase 
only the durable portion of a tying arrangement may actually be unprofi table for the fi rm 
to serve.
Because the frequency of purchases and the duration of the relationship between the 
customer and the fi rm are the key drivers of profi t in a tying arrangement, fi rms operating 
in these markets often examine customer lifetime values. The customer lifetime value is 
the profi t that a fi rm can anticipate earning from a customer during the span of the rela-
tionship. Customer lifetime value calculations, as we will see in Chapter 13, highlight the 
importance of retaining customers in tying arrangements to generate profi ts.
In other words, once the sale of the durable good is made at a low or perhaps even 
negative profi t margin, the fi rm must expect that it will retain that customer and generate 
profi ts in the future through the sale of the consumable goods. Customer defections, or the 
creation of aftermarkets where customers can purchase the consumable goods though an 
alternative supplier, destroy the ability of tying arrangements to generate profi ts.
To reduce customer defection and restrict the ability of customers to seek the consum-
able part of the tied goods from another source, fi rms often use some form of switching 
barrier within the market for the consumable good. The switching barrier may be a pat-
ented interface between the consumable and durable good. For instance, gaming consoles 
require gaming media that has been generated through patent-protected and licensed soft-
ware. Alternatively, fi rms have attempted to use a simple contractual arrangement wherein 
the sale of the durable good binds customers to purchasing the consumable good from 
that manufacturer. For instance, mobile telephone network operators often provide free 
handsets in exchange for a long-term service contract.5 In a few cases, fi rms will have little 
other infl uence over future purchases than customer inertia. For instance, Apple has given 
away music management software (iTunes) in an attempt to capture revenue through the 
sale of music at the iTunes store, but customers can use iTunes with any digital music for-
mat. For whichever format used, executives will seek to create a proprietary aftermarket 
to lock customers into purchasing the consumable product specifi cally from that fi rm. 
Competition drives the price of the durable good down in markets that use tying ar-
rangements. For instance, markets for razor handles and blades, two tied goods, are highly 
competitive. Producers of blades and handles compete strongly for customers. In these 
markets, customers have a tendency to select products based on the price of the fi rst sale 
and routinely underestimate the future costs of further sales. In a tying arrangement, the 
fi rst item sold will be a durable item that forms the basis for the future fi rm-customer 
relationship. The consumable goods required to derive value from the durable good are 
purchased only in the future. Hence, the initial price that customers pay for the durable 
good may have more infl uence over their product selection than the potential future prices 
they have to pay for the tied consumable good. When the basis of product selection is the 
price of the durable good, fi rms are encouraged to lower the price of the durable good and 
capture profi ts through higher-priced tied goods. 
In contrast, fi rms in two-part tariff markets often face limited competition for custom-
ers. For instance, consider some fi rms that use two-part tariffs. Utilities have often been

described as natural monopolies, even though modern deregulation has attempted to in-
troduce competition. Likewise, amusement parks like those run by Disney have a monop-
oly on their branded character, Mickey Mouse in Disney’s case, eliminating competition 
for customers who seek to have their photo taken with the profi t-generating character (or 
rodent in Disney’s case).
While tying arrangements are common, they have also been subject to numerous legal 
restrictions.6 In a famous case involving Xerox, U.S. courts ruled that tying arrangements 
can violate certain antitrust laws. Similar decisions have been made in many other judicial 
territories. In the Xerox case, copier machines were sold with contractual obligations for 
customers to purchase all future supplies, including paper, from Xerox. The courts ruled 
this arrangement illegal. Specifi cally, court cases have been interpreted to suggest that 
tying arrangements are subject to legal action when (1) two separate products or services 
are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional pur-
chase of the tied product; (3) the seller has suffi cient power in the market for the tying 
product; (4) a not-insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market 
is affected.
As with other pricing strategies and tactics, executives should not simply choose to 
avoid any consideration of tying arrangements due to legal concerns, nor should they 
blithely pursue them. Rather, they should choose a pricing structure that maximizes profi ts 
without crossing the line into legal restrictions and ethical challenges. From the numerous 
examples, we can see that tying arrangements are often legal. 
JAZZ CLUBS AND MULTIPART PRICING—AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
To elucidate how a multipart price structure works, we have chosen jazz clubs. Consider a 
jazz club that charges a $25 entrance fee at the door and $7 per beverage. The entrance fee 
grants customers the right to come into the club and consume beverages. Without paying 
the entrance fee, customers would not be able to visit the bar and enjoy a drink. All cus-
tomers must pay the entrance fee to enter the jazz club and purchase drinks if they want. 
The number of beverages consumed is the metric that determines the total price paid by 
customers. The $7 per beverage is the metered price. Customers do not have to purchase 
a beverage; hence, they can determine their total price paid for an evening’s entertainment 
as they wish. 
To see the effect of a multipart price structure at a jazz club, we can calculate the total 
price paid and the average price per beverage as customers increase their consumption. 
Exhibit 9-1 presents a schedule of the total expenditures as a customer consumes more 
beverages. After entering the jazz club and having only one beverage, the total price paid 
is $32. After six beverages, the total expenditures will reach $67.

Chapter 9 
Price Structures and Multipart Pricing
The tastiness and thirst-quenching characteristics of a beverage are not the only drivers 
to encourage customers to purchase beverages at the jazz club. If the price of a beverage 
at a jazz club was set only by the thirst-quenching properties of the beverage, then surely 
the price per beverage would be much lower. Customers have alternatives such as visiting 
a convenience store or staying at home and drinking tap water. Rather, the main driver of 
value to the customer at a jazz club is the jazz and the environment.
As customers spend more time in the jazz club, they derive more value from the experi-
ence. Part of the purpose of the beverages is to provide customers with something to keep 
their hands busy as they while away their time in the jazz club. To some degree, beverages 
are a proxy metric for the time spent in the jazz club. As customers buy more beverages, 
they are also spending more time in the jazz club. With each beverage consumed, they de-
rive more benefi ts from the experience, and therefore they have a higher willingness to pay 
for the overall experience. The sale of beverages enables the jazz club to capture a price 
that is somewhat proportionate to the overall time spent by a customer at the jazz club or 
the value it delivers to individual customers.
To make this relationship clear, suppose that on average a customer drinks one bever-
age every 30 minutes. We can make a schedule of the price paid in proportion to both this 
person’s beverage consumption and time spent at the jazz club. See Exhibit 9-1. From this 
perspective, we see that the total price paid over the course of a three-hour visit to the jazz 
club increases every half hour. 
Why is time itself not the metric? As with many markets, the actual metric that drives 
value for the customer may be diffi cult to measure or diffi cult to use to extract payment 
from the customer. In creating a proxy metric for value, fi rms will identify a portion of the 
offer that is related to the true value that customers gain from the product, even though 
that proxy metric may have little in common with the cost structure of the fi rm. 
For instance, referring back to our example of the jazz club, the cost of a beverage is a 
very small portion of the price per beverage at most jazz clubs. The real costs are mostly fi xed 
with respect to hiring jazz musicians and staff and paying rent. However, charging customers 
directly for the jazz club’s fi xed costs would be unpalatable for many customers.
Which part of the multipart price structure delivers greater profi ts for fi rms operating 
in competitive markets but enjoying limited customer switching between competitors? 
Consider the price structure from the perspective of attracting and capturing customers. 
If customers are more sensitive to the price of the metered good than the entrance fee, 
then the entrance fee will tend to be priced relatively high while the metered good may 
be priced relatively low. For instance, amusement park users tend to be more sensitive to 
the price per ride than the price to enter the amusement park, hence the more successful 
amusement parks tend to price rides low (if not free), while park entrance fees are set 
relatively high. However, if customers are more sensitive to the entrance fee than the price 
of the metered good, then the entrance fee will tend to be priced relatively low while the
metered fee is priced relatively high. For instance, gamers tend to be more sensitive to 
the price of the gaming console than they are to the price per game, hence the domi-
nant gaming platform makers tend to price gaming consoles low (if not at a loss), while 
 individual games are priced relatively high. 
Returning to our example of the jazz club, $7 per beverage is relatively in line with 
the price paid for beverages at comparable high-end establishments; hence, customers are 
likely to fi nd it acceptable. Similarly, a $25 charge to enter the jazz club is somewhat low 
for a live concert; hence, many customers would fi nd it acceptable as well. In terms of prof-
its, the jazz club is likely to make most of its profi ts on beverages because it is customary 
for the musicians to take a substantial cut of the entrance fees.
Also calculated in Exhibit 9-1 is the average price paid per half hour. Notice that the 
average price per half hour decreases as a customer spends more time at the jazz club. If 
we plot the average price paid per half hour against time, we fi nd a curve that resembles

a demand curve. In this way, a multipart price structure can be said to mirror demand 
heterogeneity in the market. See Exhibit 9-2.
MULTIPART PRICE STRUCTURES IN INDUSTRY
As we have seen, the multipart price structure can enable a fi rm to better capture profi ts 
from their customers. Combined, the entrance fee plus the metered fee, or durable plus 
consumable good sales, enable the fi rm to shift profi ts between different parts of the pric-
ing structure. Furthermore, the unit being priced can be closely related to the true driver of 
customer benefi ts while not actually refl ecting any metric of costs or delivering signifi cant 
benefi ts in and of itself.
Other fi rms also take advantage of the ability of multipart price structures to enhance 
profi ts. We fi nd multipart price structures in the utility, enterprise software, publishing, 
partial ownership industries, and health care industries, among others. In each case, cus-
tomers will gain some utility simply by having access to the product provided, and then 
they gain further utility from actually using and interacting with the product. The choice 
of the unit being metered and priced in a two-part tariff will depend on factors relating to 
both the cost and the value that customers place on the product.
Utilities
Utilities use one of the purest forms of a two-part tariff. They regularly charge a metering 
fee or connection fee plus a price per quantity of utility delivered. For electricity, the unit 
metered is typically the kilowatt-hours of power delivered. In natural gas, the gas delivered 
is typically metered and priced per therm or cubic meter. For water, a utility might measure 
cubic feet of water, liters, or some other volumetric measure. For telecommunications, 
minutes used or gigabytes transferred can be measured and priced. 
All customers benefi t from having access to the utility services; hence, all customers 
have some willingness to pay simply because they are connecting to the utility. Even a 
“green home” would benefi t from having backup electricity provided by the local util-
ity. The value that customers place on using the output of the utility varies in proportion 
to the quantity being used. For instance, residential customers may value keeping the 
 refrigerator cold much higher than adding a fi fteenth light to their home. When it comes

to heating, they may face alternatives between using electricity and using natural gas. Two-
part tariffs charge low-usage customers a higher average price than high-usage customers 
in proportion to their willingness to pay. Low-usage customers are willing to pay a high 
price for the few kilowatt-hours that they use to keep the refrigerator on plus a few lights, 
but they have little willingness to pay for further consumption. High-usage customers 
have a higher willingness to pay for consumption with respect to the value that they place 
on extra lighting or electric heating. 
Enterprise Software
The price of an enterprise software license is often constructed from some combination of 
base plus unit prices, where the unit is some metric that refl ects use. Enterprise software 
fi rms should attempt to make the unit price closely related to the actual value that a cus-
tomer derives from using the product. Though many software fi rms charge on a per-user, 
concurrent-user, or (licensed) seat basis, other fi rms have become far more creative with 
their approach in uncovering metrics that are more closely associated with value. 
For instance, a software fi rm that sells a platform for managing transactions related to 
food ingredients and certifi cates of analysis used the volume of transactions, rather than 
number of users, as the metric. Another software fi rm that sells a billing and customer-care 
product used the number of customers managed by the customer’s company as a means 
for determining the price. Inventory management software can be priced in proportion to 
the average number of units inventoried, educational software may be priced according to 
the number of students at the school, hospital software according to the number of beds 
in the hospital, and industrial design management software can be priced according to the 
number of designs under management. 
Some enterprise software fi rms will even set the metric proportional to the complexity 
of the problem managed. In this case, it is assumed that some customers may use only a 
portion of the potential functionality of the software even though the entire software is 
available, while other customers will exploit the full functionality of the software, thus 
deriving greater value and having a higher willingness to pay.
When pricing enterprise software, the goal should not be simply to price according 
to the number of users, but rather to uncover a metric that is closely associated with the 
value that enterprises derive from using that software. Users may be poorly correlated 
with value. Similar claims may be made when pricing information goods, such as access to 
stock prices, law journals, or auto care and damage history.
Partial Ownership
Multipart price structures are also common in partial ownership industries, such as time-share 
vacation homes, leased-time yachting, or car sharing. An annual membership fee may be as-
sociated with the cost of customer management, while also granting members access to the 
shared asset. Usage fees have been observed to be determined on a per-week, per weekend, 
per-day, or per-hour basis. Heavy users pay a lower average price per use, while light users pay 
a higher average price per use. As with other multipart price structures, the average price paid 
will somewhat match the consumers’ willingness to pay for marginal consumption.
Healthcare 
One may say that even healthcare pricing functions effectively as a multipart price struc-
ture. Healthcare customers may purchase insurance that ensures access to health care and 
then pay a second fee per doctor’s visit or medical service. As with other products and ser-
vices, customers derive value from having access to the service separate from the value that 
they derive from actually using the service, making multipart pricing palatable as a pricing 
mechanism for the market. All customers derive value from knowing that healthcare is

available when needed. Also, by pricing for the use of health care, even if it is only a nomi-
nal fee, the structure can discourage abusive practices such as patients taking up doctors’ 
time on issues not medically signifi cant.
Ink
Computer printer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard (HP) have one of the purest forms 
of tying arrangements. Typically, the price of printers is low to capture customers while 
the price of ink is high to capture profi ts. The printer is the durable portion of the sale, 
while the ink is the consumable. HP ties the sale of ink to its sale of printers through 
proprietary technology that governs the interface between an HP ink cartridge and an 
HP printer. To solidify the tie between printer and ink sales further, HP requires custom-
ers to accept an agreement that mandates the exclusive use of HP ink in exchange for a 
product warranty.
REFINING THE ENTRANCE FEE AND METERED PRICE
Executives often fi nd that they can improve revenues further and capture a greater share 
of the value that they deliver to customers by altering the entrance fee or metered price.7  
For instance, consider the decision tradeoffs of very-high-volume customers. High-volume 
applications often face different, perhaps wider alternatives than low-volume usages. The 
greater number of alternatives may depress the willingness to pay of these customers on 
a per-use basis. Alternatively, a high-usage customer may be willing to pay signifi cantly 
more for access to the service than a low-usage customer, and thus, the two-part tariff still 
fails to capture value in proportion to usage.
One approach to managing the disparity in willingness to pay of low-volume custom-
ers over high-volume customers has been to use a block tariff. The block tariff refers to 
changing the price of the metered service at different levels of consumption. The fi rst block 
of consumption will be priced somewhat higher than subsequent blocks. After a customer 
has consumed that much or more of a service, the metered price will decrease until the 
next block of consumption has been breached. The last block of service is priced at or 
above the long-run average marginal cost to produce.
For instance, the metered part of electric power is often priced through a block tariff. 
See Exhibit 9-3. As consumption increases, the price per unit of consumption decreases 
at specifi c points. The utilities profi t from this approach both by capturing higher prices 
from light users who require electricity for lighting, and by capturing profi table marginal 
revenue from heavy users who require electricity for heating as well.

Price Structures and Multipart Pricing
Recently, utilities have come under pressure from regulators to discourage consump-
tion of their product rather than encourage it. Realizing that certain resources are limited, 
such as water, or that negative externalities, such as global warming and carbon produc-
tion from fossil-fueled electric plants, are factored poorly into the costs of production, 
regulators have sought to use pricing as a means of changing consumer behavior and 
 discourage excessive use. In both residential water and electricity markets, market regula-
tors are considering price structures such that the initial consumption is priced low and the 
price per consumption increases as consumption increases. This pricing mechanism is not 
one designed to maximize profi ts, but rather to ensure that all residential customers have 
access to a basic level of service and to charge higher prices from customers who have a 
much higher consumption level to discourage this behavior. The result has been named an 
inclined tariff. See Exhibit 9-4.
Alternatively, Zipcar, a car-sharing fi rm, structures its rate plans at two different levels, 
each with a distinct entrance fee and per-hour fee.8 The “occasional driving plan” charges 
an annual fee of $50 and has hourly rates starting at $9.25. (Specifi c hourly rates depend 
upon the type of car used.) The “extra value” plan requires a monthly fee of $50, making 
the annual equivalent $600, but the hourly rates are lower, starting at $8.33. As block 
tariffs demonstrated with electricity prices, this price structure allows Zipcar to segment 
customers according to their demand. Unlike block tariffs, this structure changes both the 
entrance fee and the metered fee simultaneously. 
Summary
• The price structure is a strategic means to price-segment the market. It defi nes 
the method by which the total transaction price is determined. Once established, 
price structures are more diffi cult to alter than the other aspects of pricing, hence 
changes in price structures redefi ne the frontier of competition.
• The core issue in establishing a price structure is identifying the basic unit that 
is priced. While it may be most natural to defi ne the priced unit according to a 
specifi c tangible good, it is possible in many markets to associate the priced unit 
more closely with the benefi ts that customers derive from the product. When 
executives structure prices to match the benefi ts that customers derive from its 
products, the fi rm can both capture higher profi ts and serve more customers. 
• Because some of the more effective price structures are those that refl ect the value 
that customers place on the product, executives should seek to understand demand

heterogeneity, or the differences in willingness to pay associated with different 
purchasing situations, customer segments, and markets, in defi ning the pricing 
structure.
• In a two-part tariff price structure, the total price for using the product is deconstructed 
into two elements. The fi rst element is an entrance fee charged to all customers 
regardless of their level of consumption. The second element is a metered fee that 
tracks the units consumed. In an extreme form, the entrance fee is priced to extract all 
value from customers, while the metered fee is priced to recapture marginal costs.
• Similarly, in a tying arrangement, there are two prices for selling a set of products 
that function together to deliver value to customers. In a classic deployment of a 
tying arrangement, the fi rst product is a durable good and the second product is a 
consumable good that is used in conjunction with the durable good. From a profi t-
capturing perspective, tying arrangements are the polar opposite of two-part tariffs. 
In a tying arrangement, the durable product is priced with a relatively low margin 
while the consumable product is priced with a relatively high margin. In many 
cases, the profi ts from the consumable portion of the sale are used to subsidize the 
losses from the durable portion of the sale. 
• Both two-part tariffs and tying arrangements are subject to regulatory intervention 
and legal restrictions in some situations, but they are permitted in numerous 
situations.
Exercises
 1. A rental car fi rm’s executive is considering two different price structures: price per 
day versus price per mile. Identify a situation in which a price-per-day structure 
would most match the value that customers are willing to pay. Alternatively, 
identify a situation in which a price-per-mile structure would most match the value 
that customers are willing to pay. 
 2. Congestion road pricing has often been suggested by economists as a means 
of reducing traffi c during rush hour. Under congestion road pricing, high tolls 
are extracted from drivers during high-traffi c periods, while low or no tolls are 
extracted from drivers during low-traffi c periods. In what way would congestion 
road price structures match demand heterogeneity?
 3. Costco and Sam’s Club both offer annual memberships in exchange for discounted 
prices. Customers tend to purchase items in bulk at Costco and Sam’s Club. How are 
shopping clubs like Costco or Sam’s Club priced like a two-part tariff? Do two-part 
tariffs simply offer “bulk discounts”? What other sources of value might the annual 
membership confer to patrons of Costco or Sam’s Club? 
 4. Both HP and Kodak offer printers and ink to the market. HP tends to price their 
printers low and their ink high. Kodak tends to price their printers high and their 
ink low. What is the price structure used by HP? By Kodak? If customers are more 
sensitive to the upfront price of a printer, which price structure is likely to prove 
more profi table?
 5. A plastic injection molding company sells both molds and plastic pieces from the 
mold. The executives are uncertain whether they should price their molds and 
plastic pieces in a manner that resembles a two-part tariff or a tying arrangement. 
If customers tend to be concerned with long-run manufacturing costs, which price 
structure is likely to capture the larger number of customers? If customers tend to 
be concerned with upfront design costs, which price structure is likely to capture 
the larger number of customers?

An Economic Model of a Two-Part Tariﬀ  
HOMOGENEOUS MARKET
One of the earliest price structures examined after the development of economics as a 
study of the relationship between prices, demand, and supply was the two-part tariff.9 In 
the simplest models, the market was defi ned to be completely homogeneous in that all cus-
tomers were assumed to have the same willingness to pay for additional units and derive 
the exact same consumer surplus for participating in the market. With completely homo-
geneous demand, two-part tariffs can extract all the value that consumers derive from the 
product into the form of profi ts for the fi rm. While this model is useful for demonstrating 
the value to the fi rm of two-part tariffs, it is highly questionable in actually setting prices 
due to the numerous gross approximations of demand homogeneity. 
To demonstrate, let us evaluate the optimal pricing and maximum profi t that a fi rm 
can earn when using a two-part tariff. The two-part tariff requires two prices. Let PE be 
the entrance fee paid by all customers. Let PM be the metered price, or price per unit pur-
chased. Paying the entrance price grants permission to consumers to pay the metered price 
per item in a two-part tariff pricing structure.
Furthermore, let us use a linearly downward-sloping demand curve for each individual 
customer:
q 5 qmax   ( 1 2   P M  
___ 
S  ) 
Eq. 9.1
S is the maximum utility that any customer can derive from the product, and therefore that 
is the highest price that can be charged. When the metered price equals the maximum util-
ity (PM 5 S), no units are sold. Similarly, qmax is the maximum units that a customer would 
purchase. When the metered price is zero (PM 5 0), the demand is maximized (q 5 qmax). See 
Exhibit 9-5. Equation 9.1 is highly similar to Equation 6.1, used in Appendix 6, with the 
exception of using an individual’s demand, q, rather than the overall market’s demand, Q, 
and the incorporation of the new metered price, PM. Because the market is considered to be 
completely homogeneous, the overall market’s demand is equal to the individual’s demand 
multiplied by the number of individuals within the market. If we let N be the number of 
individuals in the market, we fi nd 
Q 5 N  q 
Eq. 9.2
The maximum possible entrance price that the fi rm can extract from customers would 
be the potential value that customers would gain by consuming whatever amount of prod-
uct they purchase. Graphically, in the absence of an entrance fee, the value that a customer 
gains is defi ned by the area of the triangle bounded along the diagonal by the demand and 
along the base by the metered price paid. This area is represented as the shaded area in 
Exhibit 9-6. The height of this triangle is simply the difference between the utility gained by 
entering the market (S) and the metered price (PM). The base of the triangle is the number

  (S 2 V)2 
Eq. 9.9
after substituting Equation 9.7 for the optimal metered price into Equation 9.3 for the 
optimal entrance fee and simplifi cation. 
We can contrast the optimal prices within a two-part tariff to that found in a per-unit 
fee price structure. In Appendix 6, we derived both the optimal unit prices and the profi t 
when the fi rm had only one unit price that it offered to the entire market. We see that the 
optimal metered price in a two-part price structure (Eq. 9.7) is below the optimal unit price 
in a per-unit price structure (Eq. 6.5.) Hence, customers can be expected to consume more of 
a product when the fi rm uses a two-part price structure than they would if the fi rm offered 
only per-unit pricing. (Compare Equation 6.6 to Equation 9.1.) In an optimized two-part 
price structure with a homogeneous market, the fi rm earns all its profi ts from the entrance 
fee. These profi ts are signifi cantly greater than what the fi rm could have earned with per-
unit pricing only. In fact, by comparing Equation 6.7 to Equation 9.9, we see that the profi t 
contribution doubles when the fi rm uses a two-part tariff rather than per-unit pricing alone. 
The simplicity of the two-part tariff in increasing profi ts from an economic perspective 
is compelling for many executives. In essence, the two-part tariff enables the fi rm to opti-
mize its profi ts by setting its metered price equal to the marginal cost to produce, thus en-
couraging customers to purchase as much of the product as they possibly could demand. 
Meanwhile, the fi rm captures profi ts by extracting all the value that consumers gain from 
the product through the entrance fee. Because the two-part tariff is one of the cleanest 
forms of perfect price discrimination in homogeneous markets, government regulations 
often limit the ability of fi rms to maximize their profi ts through two-part tariffs in markets 
that have a tendency to behave in monopolistic manners.
However, as we alluded to earlier, this model made a number of simplifying assumptions. 
One of the most damaging assumptions was that the market was perfectly homogeneous; in 
other words, all customers had the exact same willingness to pay for each unit consumed.
HETEROGENEOUS MARKET
By incorporating market heterogeneity into our models, we immediately fi nd that the 
power of a two-part tariff to increase profi ts is limited. To demonstrate the effect of mar-
ket heterogeneity on optimal prices and profi ts in a two-part tariff, let us consider a mar-
ket with two segments. Let segment A have a higher demand for the product than segment 
B (SA  SB). Using a similar model for consumer demand as before but adjusting for the 
distinction in demand between segment A and B, we can state

Chapter 9 
Price Structures and Multipart Pricing
In effect, Equation 9.10 states that both market segments A and B have the same willing-
ness to pay per unit, but overall, segment A is willing to purchase more units than seg-
ment B. A plot of these demand curves, shown in Exhibit 9-6, shows two parallel demand 
curves, each having the same slope but one positioned above the other.
Furthermore, let us once again assume that the market consists of N customers, but 
this time, we know a fraction of them are in segment A and the rest are in segment B. If x 
(pronounced “chi”) is the fraction of the market in segment A, then 1 2 x is the fraction 
of the market in segment B. Hence, the number of units sold becomes
Q 5 N  [x  qA 1 (1 2 x)  qB] 
Eq. 9.11
With two market segments, each facing the same offer for the entrance fee and metered 
price, the fi rm cannot set the entrance fee at a level that extracts all the consumer surplus. 
Instead, the maximum entrance fee that it can extract from the market is simply the value 
gained by those customers with the least demand. This value is represented by the shaded 
area in Exhibit 9-6. Once again, the area of this triangle is half of the difference between 
the maximum utility that the least-demanding segment gains from the product and the 
metered price (SB 2 PM) multiplied by the quantity that this segment will purchase at this 
metered price qB. After simplifi cation, we fi nd the optimal entrance fee to be

E 5   q max

2 S B   (SB 2 PM)2 
Eq. 9.12
Any higher price would drive the segment B customers out of the market. A price that was 
any lower would fail to capture the maximum profi ts for the fi rm.
On an average-customer basis, the fi rm’s profi t equation consists of the fi xed entry fee 
charged to every customer plus the average units sold per customer multiplied by the profi t 
margin between the metered price and the variable costs. From Equation 9.11, we know 
that the average number of units sold to a customer is simply x  qA 1 (1 2 x)  qB; hence 
the average profi t earned per customer is
pi 5 PE 1 [x  qA 1 (1 2 x)  qB]  (PM 2 V) 
Eq. 9.13
We have once again assumed that fi xed costs are zero to simplify the math without  losing 
generality.

Market heterogeneity has two signifi cant effects on a two-part tariff. The fi rst is that it 
reduces the optimal entry fee to participate in the market by a factor related to the fraction 
of customers who have a higher demand for the product and the differences in demand 
between the two segments. The second is that it increases the optimal metered price by 
an amount dependent on the size of the two segments and, again, the differences in de-
mand between the two segments. In total, the effect of increasing the metered price, thus 
selling fewer units and decreasing the entry fee, and thus capturing less of the value that 
customers derive from the product, both lead to a lower profi tability of two-part tariffs as 
markets become increasingly heterogeneous.

This leads to a generalization that executives should move toward using a higher entry 
fee and setting the metered price closer to the variable costs as customers become more 
homogeneous. As the market becomes more heterogeneous, executives should set a higher 
metered price and a lower entry fee. Eventually, the two-part tariff structurally devolves 
into a tying arrangement as market heterogeneity increases.

n examining price structures, we quickly realize that products are rarely sold in 
isolation. Rather, customers will purchase multiple items to use in conjunction with 
each other to achieve their goals. When the purchase of one product leads to an 
increased likelihood of purchase for another product, we can call these two products 
complementary products. Add-on and accessory pricing concerns complementary product 
pricing.

Add-ons, Accessories, and Complementary Products
Many products are the gateway to additional add-on modules or optional accessories. 
Add-ons and accessories are found in tangible and intangible goods, durables and con-
sumables, and business and consumer products. For instance, Apple iPods and iPhones can 
be accessorized with a Bose iPod docking station and speakers. Likewise, General Electric 
(GE) washing machines can be purchased in isolation or in conjunction with a GE dryer; 
and enterprise software can be purchased to manage a single business function or multiple 
business functions with add-on modules.
When we identify a particular product as the gateway to the purchase of other prod-
ucts, we have identifi ed an add-on or accessory pricing structure. Within an add-on 
pricing structure, there are subtle effects arising from consumer behavior that can drive 
changes to the pricing structure away from that which would be predicted from pure 
economic tradeoffs alone. For instance, economic tradeoffs derived either from conjoint 
analysis or exchange value calculators might imply that an accessory adds $5 to the value 
of a product. However, some consumer behavioral effects and more subtle economic 
 effects may enable the fi rm to capture more than $5 from the sale of an accessory, and 
other effects may drive the value differential between the base product and the acces-
sory to less than $5. Understanding these effects enables executives to improve add-on 
and accessory pricing beyond that which direct price-level measurements would imply, 
and target promotional pricing towards the part of the offer that will lead to the largest 
improvement in profi t.
Add-on Price Structure
Add-on pricing is the default approach for most products, and the approach is relatively 
unlimited in its application. We see add-on price structures in pizza and pizza toppings, 
automobiles and optional features, mobile handsets and related accessories, even tennis 
rackets and balls. In industrial markets, fi rms will sell tens of thousands of units, each 
priced individually, where the total invoice price is the sum of each unit price multiplied 
by the number of units ordered, and therefore the purchase price of one item is added to 
the purchase price of the others to form the total invoice price. 
At a high level, any product that is used in conjunction with other products can be 
examined through the lens of an add-on pricing structure. Also, any product in which 
the benefi ts and parts can be deconstructed to be additive and customers will use or 
value the product in different ways can be considered from the perspective of an add-on 
strategy.1 
In an add-on price structure, distinct products are priced and sold individually. The 
products may be independent complements, wherein the purchase of any one product 
increases the likelihood of the purchase of any other complementary product, but each 
product can provide benefi ts independently. For instance, vanilla ice cream and Reese’s 
peanut butter cups each provide value independently, but they can also be consumed 
jointly. Alternatively, the products may be tied complements, wherein the base product de-
fi nes the product category and complementary products can be purchased to enhance the 
benefi ts of the base product, yet the complementary products provide little benefi t without 
the base product. For example, customers may want cheese pizza and enhance it with pep-
peroni topping, but they rarely purchase pepperoni without the base pizza product.
Within an add-on or accessory pricing structure, the total price paid is a sum of the 
constituent parts of the purchase. If product A is priced at price PA, and product B is priced 
at price PB, then the price paid for both product A and B is PTotal 5 PA 1 PB. A simple eco-
nomic model of add-on pricing is provided in Appendix 10.
The margin structure within an add-on pricing strategy is not as straightforward as it is 
with stand-alone products. As discussed, pricing stand-alone products is largely infl uenced 
by competitive issues and the differential value of that product with respect to similar

products. Add-on pricing structures may appear at fi rst glance to be an extension of unit 
pricing; however, further factors can skew the prices within an add-on strategy. With add-
on products, the price structure is also infl uenced by the potential to use add-on products 
as a price segmentation hedge and the impact of complementary product sales on the sale 
of the base product.
From a pure price segmentation perspective, one might expect the price of a base prod-
uct to yield a lower contribution margin than the price of the complementary product. 
Add-on pricing structures can be a form of price discrimination wherein customers who 
seek higher utility pay for that increased utility by purchasing additional features, and 
customers who have a lower willingness to pay purchase only the core product and forego 
utility-enhancing optional features. In this way, the base product represents the entry point 
into the product category. A pure price segmentation argument with perfect segmenta-
tion hedges would suggest that the base product should be designed to yield the minimal 
benefi ts required to satisfy customers with the lowest willingness to pay and be priced at a 
level that would attract the largest market. Further add-ons, or complementary products, 
would enhance the benefi ts of the base product and could serve as a means to capture 
higher profi ts from customers with a higher willingness to pay. 
However, price segmentation is not the only factor that infl uences an add-on pricing 
structure. With complementary products, sales of the base product affect the sales of add-
on products, and vice versa. Furthermore, network, signpost, and competitive effects all 
infl uence the price structure within an add-on strategy. Hence, there are many different 
infl uences on setting the price and determining contribution margins of the base product 
and complementary products.
The base product could yield small margins and the complementary products could 
yield high margins, such as with computer printers and ink, or razor handles and blades, 
as discussed in Chapter 9. Alternatively, the base product could yield high margins and the 
complementary products could yield low margins, such as with tennis rackets and tennis 
balls. Likewise, both the base and complementary products could yield somewhat equal 
margins, such as with desks and chairs.
We can quantify the margin challenge mathematically. Let %CMA and %CMB be the 
percentage of the contribution margin on products A and B respectively, where A is the 
base product and B is the add-on product. In constructing an add-on price structure, 
executives must determine if the contribution margins will be similar to that of a tying
arrangement, in which %CMA , %CMB, or similar to that of a two-part tariff in which 
%CMA . %CMB, or relatively constant in which %CMA 5 %CMB.
Along with the challenge of defi ning the price and margin structure in an add-on strat-
egy, marketers face the challenge of defi ning which attributes and features should be in-
cluded in the base product and which should be developed as complementary or optional 
features. The desire to penetrate a new market or respond to an economic downturn with 
a lower price point may encourage fi rms to reduce the features in the base product and 
offer them as options instead. In other situations, competitive pressures, market evolution, 
and network effects may encourage the fi rm to take previously optional features and com-
bine them into the base product.
Determining which part of a set of complementary goods delivers higher margins, or 
whether all complements yield similar margins, is a highly strategic issue subject to many 
infl uences. We will examine how add-on price structures enable price segmentation before 
turning to the infl uences on an optimal add-on pricing and margin structure. 
Left out of this consideration is the possibility that complementary products will can-
nibalize sales of the base product. Such a situation would be considered as substitutes, not 
complements, and the sales of substitutes tend to be negatively correlated while the sales 
of complements tend to be positively correlated. Complementary products encourage the 
sale of one another. As such, the price for one affects the volume sold of that item as well as

the volume sold of its complement, and therefore the optimal price for the complementary 
product. From a formal economic point of view, we would state that the cross-product 
elasticity of demand, or the percent change in quantity sold of one unit with respect to the 
percent change in price of another unit, is negative for complements.
Price Segmentation in Add-on Price Structures
To demonstrate an add-on price structure, let us examine the options associated with a 
Nokia 6103 mobile phone handset in 2007. The Nokia 6103 could be purchased with 
many additional accessories. There was a car kit for enabling hands-free conversations 
while driving; a connectivity cable to enable the handset to work in conjunction with 
a computer for updating contacts, synchronizing the calendar, downloading photos, or 
uploading ringtones and music; a travel charger for various countries with different plug 
receptor styles; an automobile charger; and an audio adapter for listening to music or having 
conversations without holding the phone against the ear. See Exhibit 10-1.
An individual customer may seek a specifi c set of features. In an add-on price structure, 
each customer can select the specifi c features that he or she desires. Moreover, different 
customers may have different levels of demand for a specifi c accessory. Demand for one 
feature may be high for some customers and low for others. Plotting the demand for a 
feature along each of the features, and connecting these demands for customer segments, 
creates a spider diagram of the demand profi le for that customer. Different customers will 
have different demand profi les.
For instance, Exhibit 10-2 shows the demand profi les for two different customer seg-
ments for Nokia 6103 accessories. A customer in the traveling segment may want to have 
several travel chargers and mobile chargers but have little demand for other features. For 
example, a heavy business traveler may demand multiple travel chargers—one for work, 
one for home, one for the briefcase, and one for traveling in a foreign country where plug 
receptacles are different. Meanwhile, a returning Nokia customer who is upgrading to a 
new handset may already own the desired number and variety of chargers. This upgrad-
ing customer may instead want the added pleasure of a connectivity adapter to transfer 
numbers between handsets or the charger adapter to enable his or her old travel charger to 
work with the new handset plug-in interface. In both cases, the base Nokia 6103 handset 
will satisfy many of this person’s core functional needs, but the specifi c demand profi le for 
accessories will be different. 
As can be seen in the customer segment demand profi le, the add-on price structure
allows for a high degree of customization of the product and benefi ts delivered. This also 
enables the total price paid for the base product plus accessories to better match the will-
ingness to pay of highly heterogeneous customers. 
If all the accessories were included in a single package along with the base product, many 
customers would be asked to purchase a number of features from which they gain no benefi t, 
and the price for the single package would likely be higher than their willingness to pay. The

result would be what many customers refer to as a “gold-plated solution”: lots of features that 
no one wants, at a price that no one is willing to pay. Not only would the profi ts be damp-
ened, but the fi rm would be left vulnerable to a lower-priced and lower-featured competitor.
With an add-on strategy, the base product handset can be sold to many users with 
heterogeneous demand for additional features, and that heterogeneous demand for ad-
ditional features can be satisfi ed through the purchase of add-on products and acces-
sories at the customers’ discretion. Each accessory, or multiple units of an accessory, act 
as a segmentation hedge, separating those customers with a higher willingness to pay for 
 additional benefi ts from those without. 
Add-on price structures are highly fl exible. As can be seen from the demand profi les, 
they work well when the demand for features and benefi ts is highly heterogeneous be-
tween customers. Each customer can confi gure the product or set of products to his or 
her liking, and few customers are stuck paying for features that they do not value. When 
customer demand for features cannot be aggregated meaningfully into specifi c segments, 
add-on price structures are often found to be the easiest to manage and the most effective 
in capturing and satisfying customer demand.

Inﬂ uences to Price Levels in Add-on Price Structures
Within an add-on pricing structure, there are consumer behavioral effects that enable fi rms 
to capture higher margins with either the add-on modules or the base product. Some better-
understood effects are the signpost effect, the optional equipment effect, network externali-
ties, and the lock-in effect. Both the signpost and optional equipment effects are highly driven 
by the diffi cult comparison effect, a challenge well understood with respect to consumer 
behavior and discussed in Chapter 5. Network externalities and lock-in are more measurable 
economic drivers to altering the price levels of add-ons compared to the base product, some 
of which may enable the fi rm to capture higher margins on the base product.
SIGNPOST EFFECT
The signpost effect argues for a low price on popular or frequently purchased products to 
induce purchase of less popular or infrequently purchased items that are priced to yield a 
higher relative contribution margin. It has mostly been explored in the context of multi-
product retail markets, as found with grocers, merchandisers, and offi ce suppliers.3
The basic premise of the signpost effect is that prices on certain items can signal to 
customers the price of other products. Furthermore, a signal given by a signpost item does 
not necessarily need to refl ect the prices of the other products accurately. Firms can use 
the signpost effect to capture higher profi ts from non-advertised or non-sale items while 
driving traffi c with the advertised or sale product. The signpost item can even act as a loss 
leader to drive traffi c and sales of complementary items. While the signpost effect has been 
studied mostly in retail store formats, it can be found in other situations as well.
The signpost effect arises from customers lacking full information of all comparable 
offers. Even if all comparable offers were made apparent to customers, they may not 
remember them accurately. For most customers, the effort required to learn all the prices 
and offers available to them outweighs the benefi ts of doing so. Humans can be said to 
be cognitive misers—they seek to store and recall information only to the extent that they 
anticipate benefi ting from the knowledge. Imperfect memory arises from the desire of cus-
tomers to minimize the effort expended to learn information with respect to the expected 
benefi ts gained by knowing that information.
Because customers do not know the prices of all products at each retail location, they 
will instead rely on an overall price image for the store in calculating their anticipated 
utility for selecting one store over another. Prices of certain items can signal to customers 
the price image of other products within a store. Pricing these items low acts as a signpost 
to customers that the overall price image of the store is that of a low-priced outlet. Firms 
can profi t from the signpost effect when they signal a low-price image while maintaining 
high prices on other items. 
For instance, a customer looking to purchase a new tennis racket might fi rst check the 
store’s price on a can of tennis balls. If the balls seem low-priced, the customer may assume 
that the tennis rackets will also be priced low. If tennis balls seem to be priced high, the 
customer may walk out and seek bargains elsewhere.
With signpost items, retailers should select items for which customers are likely to have accu-
rate expectation of prices and are complementary to the main item(s) they seek to sell. The sign-
post effect relies on the ability of customers to identify and interpret the signpost item accurately 
as priced favorably to induce customer interaction. Using popular and frequently purchased 
items for signpost pricing increases the likelihood that customers will have accurate price expec-
tations. To drive sales to the main item, these signpost items should be complementary products.
The price signal communicated through the signpost effect does not necessarily have 
to be accurate to be effective. Customers are unlikely to have accurate price informa-
tion on products that are purchased infrequently, such as furniture, stereo equipment,

or computers. Firms can use low prices on popular or frequently purchased products to 
signal an overall low-price image; meanwhile, less popular or less frequently purchased 
products can be priced to yield a relatively higher margin. For instance, low prices on
advertised items can signal an overall low-price image, while margins on unadvertised 
items can be maintained at a relatively higher level. The signpost effect will encourage the 
sale of both the advertised item and complementary products. 
Effective strategic signpost pricing has been observed under the following circum-
stances: (1) Competing stores are heterogeneous in their format, some having a higher 
cost structure and others having a lower cost structure. (2) Customers are heterogeneous 
in their store preference, perhaps due to location or product availability, cleanliness and 
decor, customer service, or length of lines. (3) Customers select which retailer to purchase 
from based upon the expected utility that they will derive from patronizing a specifi c store. 
(4) Retailers signal their overall price image through advertised prices. 
In these situations, stores can advertise the price of a select few products to increase the 
anticipated utility that a customer will capture by selecting a specifi c store. Meanwhile, 
they can sell other products at unadvertised prices that customers will discover only once 
they enter the store. Such circumstances can even encourage higher-cost retailers to price-
match lower-cost retailers on advertised products to encourage store traffi c, and yet cap-
ture profi ts through the sale of unadvertised products at higher prices. 
OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT EFFECT
Manufacturers can couple lower-margin base models with higher-margin optional equipment. 
If the baseline product is compared with competing offers and the add-on products are rarely 
compared, the diffi cult comparison effect allows manufacturers to capture higher margins on 
add-on optional equipment. Moreover, manufacturers have something of a monopoly over 
factory-installed optional equipment, and as such, they can use these add-on items to effec-
tively price-segment the market to some degree. The optional equipment effect with manufac-
turers is similar to signpost items in retail, in that a low-price offer that customers compare is 
used to drive customer traffi c that can lead to offers of higher-margin items.
We can show this with an example from the auto industry. The 2007 BMW Z4 2.5 si 
Sports Roadster, equipped to manage E85 fuel, can be confi gured with a number of 
optional factory-installed features. See Exhibit 10-3. Factory options on the BMW Z4

include exterior paint and surface, interior seat covering, interior trim, special wheel types, 
air conditioning, navigation system, folding exterior mirrors, and cruise control. The full 
price of the BMW Z4 changes substantially depending on the options selected. 
Factory-installed optional equipment, unlike tying arrangements, does not require cus-
tomers to make purchases after the initial transaction, and therefore it is unlikely to fall 
foul of antitrust concerns.
NETWORK EXTERNALITIES 
Products are said to benefi t from network externalities when the value of the product increases 
with the number of people who use it.5 For instance, the value of Adobe Portable Document 
Format (PDF) fi les increases with the number of people who are able to read a PDF fi le. 
Similarly, email, mobile text messages, and online networking platforms benefi t from network 
externalities in that the value any one user gains depends on the number of other users in the 
network. Network effects are a core strategic element behind Google’s Adwords and Adsense 
offerings, Apple’s iPhone and iPhone Apps offerings, Facebook, and even Twitter.
The network effect was fi rst codifi ed by George Gilder with fax machines in the 1980s, 
but it took Robert Metcalfe, co-inventor of the Ethernet, to popularize its consideration. 
According to Metcalfe’s law, the value of a network under positive network externalities 
increases with the square of the number of people in the network. This claim is rather 
straightforward. Consider a network that includes n people. The value created by  having 
other people in the network for any given customer is proportional to the number of other 
people in the network, or (n 2 1). Altogether, the total value of the network is propor-
tional to the value of the number of people in the network, n, multiplied by the value that 
each person derives from the network (n 2 1), or n ? (n 2 1)  n2 2 n. Thus, the value 
of the network increases with the square of the number of members within the network.
Firms that are launching products that are expected to benefi t from positive network 
effects have a high motivation to increase the number of customers on their network 
quickly. This may encourage the launch price of the product to be greatly reduced from 
what it would be priced at in the absence of network effects to drive adoption. However, 
fi rms cannot indefi nitely deliver products without capturing profi ts. They must profi t from 
the network in some manner if they are to be expected to continue supporting it. 
Network effects have led to the development of “freeware,” or freely provided popular 
software offered in the hopes of developing a valuable network. With information goods, 
the cost of creation is high, but the cost of reproduction is low, if not zero. As such, adding 
more users to a network costs the fi rm very little, if anything. However, extracting value 
for creating and maintaining the network can remain a challenge. Hence, many fi rms
offering freeware eventually seek revenue either from the users themselves or from others 
who seek access to that network. 
Network externalities can lead to aggressive pricing behavior wherein the base product 
is offered at a low price, if not free, and profi ts are captured through the sale of com-
plementary products. For instance, the pricing strategy of Adobe was to give the Adobe 
Reader for free to any user, but charge for the potential to create PDF fi les. Similarly, Apple 
priced access to its iTunes music fi le management system at zero, but it charged customers 
for downloading music through its online store. In these and similar cases, fi rms seek to 
earn profi ts from the users themselves by selling upgraded versions of the product or add-
on products that enhance the product’s functionality.
Similar to capturing profi ts from users themselves through the sale of complementary 
products, fi rms may also be encouraged to sell access to the network to third parties as a 
means of monetizing the network. The result is commonly referred to as a two-sided market, 
where one side of the market creates the network and the other side purchases access to 
that network. Using network effects to create two-sided markets is a classic strategy of

newspapers and magazines. Periodicals provide subscriptions at a price lower than the 
marginal cost to produce those periodicals to create a reader base that advertisers will pay 
dearly to access. Similarly, LinkedIn and Facebook, two popular online social networking 
platforms, enable users to interact with other users freely, but LinkedIn sells access to its 
database of users to recruiters and Facebook sells advertising space.
LOCK-IN WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS
Complementary products that increase switching costs of base products can encourage 
fi rms to price the base product high while pricing complementary products low, if not alto-
gether abdicating any monopoly power over add-on products.6 This occurs in cases where 
the base product is frequently purchased or is semidurable and purchased on the time scale 
of a year or two. To encourage customers to replace an expired item with a product from 
the same manufacturer, the fi rm can encourage customers to invest in complementary 
products. When they do, the complementary products act as a barrier to switching manu-
facturers at the time of replacement, thus locking in the customer. 
Mobile handset makers accomplish this to some degree through encouraging customers 
to purchase power chargers, headsets, and car kits that contain proprietary protocols over 
connections for interactivity. For instance, Nokia offers branded accessories and encour-
ages third parties to make compatible accessories simultaneously. When Nokia releases its 
latest handset, it sometimes takes care to ensure that it has some backward compatibility 
with earlier complementary products. 
Similarly, users who purchase Microsoft Windows will invest signifi cantly in comple-
mentary software that works only on the Windows platform. When the opportunity arises 
to switch platforms, perhaps to Linux or Apple OS X Leopard, customers may be reluc-
tant to reinvest in new software that works on the new platform.
The lock-in effect can lead to a pricing strategy wherein complementary products are 
priced aggressively to encourage their dissemination into the market, while the core prod-
uct is priced to capture profi ts as customers replace an expired product or extend their 
purchases within that category. In such a case, the fi rm may take a non-monopoly position 
in the market for complementary products because their dissemination drives the value of 
the core product.
Summary
• When the purchase of one product leads to an increased likelihood of purchasing 
another product, we can call these two products complementary products. Add-on 
and accessory pricing concerns complementary product pricing. In an add-on or 
accessory pricing structure, the price paid for a collection of individual products is 
the sum of the prices of each of those individual products. 
• Add-on price structures enable price segmentation by providing the base product to 
a larger market and the add-on or accessory products to the subset of that market 
with a higher willingness to pay for greater functionality.
• The signpost effect argues for low pricing of popular or frequently purchased 
products in retail outlets to induce purchase of less popular or infrequently 
purchased items that are priced to yield a higher relative contribution margin.
• The optional equipment effect argues for a low price of the base-level product 
produced by a manufacturer and a relatively higher price for additional equipment 
at a higher relative contribution margin.
• Network externalities can infl uence the add-on price structure. If the value of 
the core product increases with the number of customers of that core product,

manufacturers have signifi cant incentives to increase the customer base for that 
product. However, they must capture profi ts. To do so, they may either use add-on 
products to improve the margins captured from their customer base or create a 
two-sided market wherein other customers pay for access to the network.
• Complementary products can lock customers into a specifi c base product. If this 
lock-in is signifi cant, fi rms can increase the margins on their base products relative 
to the margins that they capture with add-on or accessory products.

Economic Model of Add-on Pricing7
Add-on price structures segment the market according to different customers’ willingness 
to pay for different levels of benefi ts. To construct an economic model of prices and margins 
in an add-on price structure, we must incorporate market heterogeneity into our model for 
demand before turning to the challenge of optimizing prices and maximizing profi ts. 
The simplest approach to modeling market heterogeneity in relationship to benefi ts 
derived and willingness to pay is to defi ne a “taste” parameter that varies from zero to 1. 
Every individual customer has a specifi c taste parameter. The market overall has customers 
whose taste parameter can be any number between zero and 1. Customers with a low taste 
parameter (near zero) are those who value the product little and are not willing to pay 
much for the additional benefi ts that are provided through an add-on product. Customers 
with a high taste parameter (near 1) are those who value the product highly and have some 
willingness to pay for an add-on product. This approach to defi ning market heterogeneity 
with a taste parameter is completely general and not specifi c to any specifi c market.
The taste parameter can be thought of as a measure of how well a customer can convert 
a quality improvement into utility. Some do it well (a high taste parameter), others do it 
poorly (a low taste parameter). Alternatively, the taste parameter can be considered as a 
metric of price sensitivity versus utility sensitivity. Customers with a low taste parameter 
are signifi cantly more price-sensitive, while customers with a high taste parameter are 
signifi cantly more utility-sensitive.
To demonstrate, we model customer preferences with a customer net utility function. With 
two products, products A and B, where B is the add-on to A, consumers have a utility function 
for A alone and another utility function for A and B. Let us assume that the utility customers 
gain from B is in addition to that gained in A, and that B provides zero utility in the absence 
of A. This would be the case of a pure add-on product. The net utility function is simply the 
difference between the utility that customers derive from a product and the price that they 
paid. Under these assumptions, the net utility function is given by the pair of equations 
U(t) 5 (SA ? t 2 PA) if purchasing A alone 
Eq. 10.1.a
U(t) 5 (SA ? t 2 PA) 1 (SB ? t 2 PB) if purchasing A and B 
Eq. 10.1.b
where PA and PB are the prices of products A and B, respectively, SA and SB are the maxi-
mum utilities that any customer can gain from products A and B, respectively, and t is 
our taste parameter, which varies between zero and 1. If no purchase is made, we assume 
that the customer neither gains nor loses utility—that is, that the utility function for not 
purchasing is zero. See Exhibit 10-4.
The taste parameter, t, accounts for the dispersion in willingness to pay between cus-
tomers, or the market heterogeneity. As a model parameter, t is bound between zero and 
1 (t P [0,1]) For customers with a taste parameter of zero, (t 5 0), they have no perceived 
utility from either the product or its add-on. For customers with a taste parameter of 1,
(t 5 1), they perceive that product A has a utility of SA and would in fact be willing to 
pay SA for the product. The fact that they have to pay only a price of PA implies that they 
gain net utility of SA 2 PA by consuming the product. Similarly, for customers with a taste
parameter of 1, (t 5 1), they perceive that the add-on product B has a utility of SB and 
would in fact be willing to pay SB for the add-on. The fact that they have to pay only a 
price of PB implies that they gain net utility of SB 2 PB by consuming the add-on. Inter-
mediate values of the taste parameter indicate the value that specifi c customers place on 
quality differences. For instance, customers with a taste parameter of two-tenths (t 5 0.2)
value quality differences 20 percent as well as customers with a taste parameter of 1. Like-
wise, customers with a taste parameter of eight-tenths (t 5 0.8) are able to value quality 
differences 80 percent as well as customers with a taste parameter of 1.

There are economically special types of customers who are indifferent between making 
a purchase and not making a purchase. These marginal customers can be identifi ed by 
their taste parameters. With two products, the base product plus its add-on product, we 
have two types of marginal customers. 
The fi rst type of marginal customers is indifferent between making no purchase and 
purchasing product A alone, which is defi ned by the taste parameter t0,A. For these cus-
tomers, their net utility for purchasing the base product is exactly zero. Any customer 
with a taste parameter greater than t0,A will receive net consumer surplus from purchas-
ing  product A and thus will purchase.  Any customer with a taste parameter less than t0,A 
would have negative net consumer surplus after purchasing and thus will not purchase. 
Thus, t0,A customers are marginal base-product customers. We assume that marginal cus-
tomers with a taste parameter equal to t0,A purchase the base product without losing gen-
erality. By setting the net utility function for purchasing product A alone (Eq. 10.1a) equal 
to zero, we fi nd the taste parameters of these marginal customers to be
t0,A   PA 
___ 
SA
  
Eq. 10.2
The second type of marginal customers, tA,A1B, is indifferent between purchasing prod-
uct A alone and purchasing both products A and B. For these customers, the difference in 
net utility for purchasing the base product compared to purchasing the base plus and add-
on product is zero. Any customer with a taste parameter greater than tA,A1B will receive 
more net utility from purchasing the add-on B with the base product A than from purchas-
ing the base product A alone, and thus this person will purchase the add-on as well. Any 
customer with a taste parameter less than tA,A1B would have less net utility after purchasing 
the add-on B than from just purchasing the base product A, and thus this person will not 
purchase the add-on. Thus, tA,A1B customers are marginal add-on customers. We assume 
that marginal customers with a taste parameter equal to tA,A1B purchase the add-on with-
out losing generality. By setting the net utility function for purchasing product A alone 
(Eq. 10.1a) equal to that for purchasing product A plus the base product (Eq. 10.1b), we 
fi nd the taste parameters of the marginal add-on customers to be

Chapter 10 
Add-ons, Accessories, and Complementary Products
Because the marginal customer between buying only one product and buying both prod-
ucts has at least bought the fi rst product, we have restrictions on the taste parameters of these 
marginal customers (0 # t0,A # tA,A1B # 1). For 0 # t , t0,A, the customer doesn’t purchase. 
For t0,A # t , tA,A1B, the customer purchases the base product A alone. For (tA,A1B # t # 1), the 
customer purchases the base product A and the add-on product B.
If the menu of prices is to be feasible in the sense that customers will voluntarily choose 
the products, then consumers of each group must prefer consuming the package intended for 
them. This is a self-selection constraint, also known as an incentive compatibility constraint. 
For the marginal customer to exist, we know that t0,A and tA,A1B must be less than
1 (t , 1). Using the equations defi ning the marginal customers, we uncover the limit of the 
market prices for the product and its add-on:
Pi , Si 
Eq. 10.4
where i is A or B. The prices must be less than the maximum utility that a customer can 
gain from the respective products.
The assumption that customers choose the base product prior to choosing an add-on 
product implies an interior self-selection constraint. This interior constraint yields a more 
interesting relationship regarding prices. For these customers, we know that t0,A # tA,A1B. 
Using the equations defi ning the marginal customers, we uncover a relationship between 
the market prices of the product and its add-on:
 SA 
___ 
PA
   SB 
___ 
PB
 
Eq. 10.5
That is, the base product A must deliver a better quality-to-price ratio than the add-on 
product B does. 
If we assume a form of the distribution of taste parameter, we can furthermore derive 
optimal prices for the base and add-on products. For simplicity, let us assume that custom-
ers are uniformly distributed in their taste parameter. Thus, 10 percent of customers have 
a “taste preference” of less than 0.1, 50 percent of customers have a “taste preference” 
of less than 0.5, 90 percent of customers have a “taste preference” of less than 0.9. While 
a uniform distribution is unlikely to be an accurate description of the way in which cus-
tomers value quality differences, it makes the analysis mathematically much simpler than 
assuming a Gaussian or beta distribution of the taste parameter. 
If there are Q total customers in the market, then the total demand for product A is
Q · (tA,A1B 2 t0,A), and the total demand for products A and B is Q ? (1 2 tA,A1B).
Having described the market and how customers make choices, we can turn to the chal-
lenge of maximizing the fi rm’s profi ts. The fi rm’s profi t equation is given by
p (PA, PB) 5 Q · (tA,AB 2 t0,A) · (PA 2 VA) 
 
 
1 Q · (1 2 tA,AB) · (PA 1 PB 2 VA 2 VB) 
Eq. 10.6
where we have set fi xed costs equal to zero without losing generality; and VA and VB 
are the variable costs of the base product A and the add-on product B, respectively. 
The fi rst term yields the profi t earned by selling the base product A alone. The second 
term yields the profi t earned from selling both the base product A and the add-on 
product B.
We can fi nd the optimal prices of products A and B at the point where the fi rst
derivative of the fi rm’s profi t equation with respect to either independently varying

The optimal prices of the base product A and the add-on product B are identical to those 
that would have been derived if they were separate products. (Compare Equation 10.9 
with Equation 6.5 in Appendix 6.) Moreover, the profi t is the same as if the products had 
been sold independently. (Compare Equation 10.14 with Equation 6.7 in Appendix 6.) In 
other words, to arrive at the price effects of the complementary nature of two products, 
such as a mobile phone and a phone charger or tennis balls and a  tennis racket, we have 
to move beyond a simple economic model and toward a model that  better incorporates 
consumer behavior. One such adjustment might be to assume that the demand for one 
of the products increases when it is sold as an add-on rather than as an isolated product. 
If either SA or SB increases due to the add-on nature of the products, then the prices and 
the fi rm’s profi ts would increase as well. Otherwise, add-on pricing is exactly the same as 
standard unit pricing.

Versioning
• What is versioning? How is versioning different from bundling or add-on pricing?
• Why might versioning be superior to pure per-unit pricing of complementary 
products? Why might it be inferior?
• How does market heterogeneity inform the choice of versioning over complementary 
product pricing?
• Are production cost savings the only reason to offer versions rather than individual 
products?
• How do different psychological effects infl uence prices within a versioning 
structure?
• How should discounts be managed when a fi rm is versioning?
• Stretch Question: Should higher-featured versions always be sold at a discount 
compared to the sum price of the individual product features?
V
ersioning is an alternative approach to price segmentation from add-ons and other 
individual unit price structures. Like add-ons and unit pricing, versioning attempts 
to price-segment customers according to their willingness to pay for marginal im-
provements in attributes, features, and benefi ts. Unlike unit pricing, versioning constrains 
the route to customers for gaining additional benefi ts to the purchase of the next, higher 
value product in a product lineup.
In versioning, different variations of a similar product are sold simultaneously. Some 
versions offer more features or benefi ts, while others offer fewer features and ben-
efi ts. As products span from feature-deprived to feature-enhanced, the price likewise 
increases.1
Versioning can be found in tangible goods markets at the retailer, manufacturer, and 
industrial levels. Retailers offer different versions of consumer products, such as store-
brand laundry detergent, Gain, and Tide. Manufacturers offer various versions of similar 
products, such as Black & Decker coffeemakers that vary according to brewing capacity,

for instance, polyethylene is sold in varying grades of purity for different uses. 
A more prevalent use of versioning is with information goods. Software suppliers
routinely version their products similarly to Intuit’s Quickbooks line of business account-
ing software or Norton’s line of computer security and maintenance software. Likewise,
fi nancial services can be sold in different versions; for instance, American Express offers 
the Green, Gold, and Platinum cards.
Even infrastructure can be marketed through versioning strategies. For instance, U.S. 
auto travelers have a choice between paying tolls with an EZPass or cash, and simply 
avoiding toll highways altogether. 
If we examine the American Express offers more closely, we fi nd a simple example of 
how versioning can be used to increase customer benefi ts and prices simultaneously.2 Each 
of the Green, Gold, and Platinum cards will enable the cashless purchase of goods and 
include the Membership Rewards loyalty program; but customers seeking a higher level 
of service or access to special events must upgrade to the Gold or Platinum version of the 
card. In addition, only the Platinum card includes travel privileges, such as giving custom-
ers instant access to airlines’ airport clubs. See Exhibit 11-1.
Likewise, we fi nd a similar theme of increasing benefi ts delivered while simultaneously 
increasing the price demanded for Norton Security.3 Norton AntiVirus, Internet Security, 
and 360 each protect users from computer viruses. However, added features such as down-
load protection, shopping protection, and wireless protection are available only through 
Internet Security and 360. If customers want to allow Norton to manage computing per-
formance automatically, they must upgrade all the way to Norton 360. See Exhibit 11-2.

Because versioning restricts choice over unit pricing mechanisms, it might be pre-
dicted that this strategy is less profi table than a comparable add-on price structure. 
With choice restricted, it is more diffi cult for the offers to match the customers’ desired 
benefi ts and willingness to pay. With suboptimal matching between products demanded 
and products offered, sales may be depressed as customers look for alternative offers. 
A competitor that avoided a versioning strategy might be able to match demand and 
products better through a more typical unit pricing offer. As such, fi rms offering ver-
sions might be perceived as being at a competitive disadvantage to fi rms that focus on 
unit pricing.
However, in many industries, fi rms fi nd that versioning is more profi table than a per-
unit pricing structure. Moreover, customers may prefer versioning over pure unit pricing. 
If customers prefer versioning and fi rms improve profi ts through versioning, then the 
effects of versioning must be beyond that of combining individual items and prices to 
create specifi c versions. 
There are multiple reasons that versions are often preferred over pure individual 
item structures, both by fi rms and customers. Versioning may deliver cost savings for 
the fi rm, which enables it to lower its prices below that which it would have used if it 
had marketed the items individually. The fi rm also may reduce challenges for customers 
by  preassembling all the necessary parts of a full product into a single package rather 
than requiring customers to identify their specifi c needs, search for the multiple items 
that satisfy their needs, and assemble them into a working whole. Beyond these purely 
economic reasons, versioning also taps into psychological effects that further improve 
the product’s receptivity by the market and therefore the profi t improvement capability 
of a versioning pricing structure for the fi rm. 
In this chapter, we will examine the versioning price structure prior to exploring 
the many effects that can lead to its competitive advantage or improve its deployment. 
In this exploration, we will uncover relationships between the prices of different ver-
sions, and contrast these prices with those that would have been used in a unit pricing 
structure. Of specifi c interest are effects that may drive the price of the version higher, 
lower, or equal to that of its equivalent compilation of unit-priced goods. That is, 
when would the price of a versioned good be different from the sum price of its addi-
tive parts?
Price Segmentation with Versioning
Strategies using versioning often rely on a good-better-best progression of products. 
The good product is priced lowest and has the fewest features and benefi ts; it is an 
entry-level product. The good product is feature-deprived, providing the minimal func-
tionality to satisfy customers. In an extreme form, it is a stripped-down version of 
a higher-value product, with the bare-bones features required to compete within the 
product category. The best product is priced the highest and has the most features and 
benefi ts; it is a top-level offering. The best product is the most feature-enhanced, pro-
viding further functionality to meet the demands of a more discriminating clientele. In 
an extreme form, it is loaded with fancy features to satisfy even the most-demanding 
customer of the product category. Between good and best lies the better product, which 
is priced in the middle of the spectrum and loaded with a medium level of features and 
benefi ts. 
Good-better-best strategies can easily be understood with a price-to-benefi ts map. As 
products progress from good to better to best, the price and benefi ts provided increase. 
Some customers are willing to pay more than others. When the willingness to pay and 
the benefi ts demanded follow a normal bell curve, we can map out the expected sales

Chapter 11 Versioning
of the different versions. If the average customer seeks the benefi ts of the better product 
and derives greater utility after paying the demanded price, we would expect the middle,
better product to be the most popular or frequently sold. The good and best products 
would attract lower levels of interest. See Exhibit 11-3.
Implementing a good-better-best strategy requires an understanding of the heterogene-
ity in benefi ts demanded. Marketers must determine which features should be used to 
enhance a product and which can be omitted to deprive a product of certain benefi ts but 
still remain within the category. The entry-level version must deliver suffi cient functionality 
to satisfy a portion of the market’s needs, but not all. The feature-enhanced versions must 
satisfy the demands of more utility-sensitive segments. The key is determining the feature 
distinction between the feature-enhanced and feature-deprived versions. Different ver-
sions must deliver meaningfully different benefi ts. The feature and benefi t differentiations 
between the products act as segmentation hedges between the utility-sensitive customers 
and price-sensitive segments.
With information goods, a common approach is to design and develop the full- featured 
product and then remove features to create the other lesser-valued versions within the 
product lineup. In fact, for software, it is argued that fi rms should make the full prod-
uct and disable certain forms of functionality to produce the feature-deprived versions. 
 Features can be stripped out from the full product to serve those with a lower willingness 
to pay. Stripping out these features may cause the fi rm to suffer additional development 
costs in making the feature-deprived version; however, these costs are usually fi xed. Like 
other fi xed costs, they have no direct economic relationship to the pricing of the versions, 
but they retain an infl uence over the economic decision to develop and market these 
versions.
The price-to-benefi ts map also indicates a key limitation of pure good-better-best ver-
sion strategies. Good-better-best approaches assume that benefi ts can be added in a mono-
tonically increasing manner, such that the highest-priced version has signifi cantly more 
features than the lower-priced version. More signifi cantly, good-better-best strategies also 
assume that customers’ heterogeneity in benefi ts sought is one-dimensional. That is, if 
the better version is created by adding enhancement E1 to a good product, and the best 
version is created by adding enhancement E2 to the better product, most customers that 
desire enhancement E2 also desire enhancement E1.

In some markets, customer heterogeneity in benefi ts demanded will correlate with 
willingness to pay. For instance, some customers are satisfi ed with a simple charge card, 
while others desire greater customer service and are willing to pay for enhanced benefi ts. 
In other markets, customer heterogeneity in benefi ts demanded does not correlate with 
willingness to pay. For instance, some customers like vanilla ice cream while others like 
chocolate, but both have the same willingness to pay. Market-specifi c customer insight 
must inform the pricing strategy of the correlation between benefi ts sought and willing-
ness to pay. In markets where benefi ts desired does not correlate with willingness to pay, 
the versioning strategy cannot take a good-better-best approach and instead must devolve 
towards a more general multi-product strategy.
From a profi tability perspective, a fi rm should not add $1 in marginal cost to a prod-
uct unless it can increase the price by more than $1, holding all else constant. For this 
reason, most fi rms will earn larger margins on their feature-enhanced versions. Indeed, 
for infrastructure- or intellectual property–based goods, the marginal cost to reproduce 
is constant between the versions and hence the contribution margins are directly propor-
tional to the price that a fi rm can capture with a product.
It is often tempting for executives to try to shift all customers to the highest-priced and 
highest-featured version. However, executives must balance this desire to shift custom-
ers towards higher price points with the potential negative consequences. Firms should 
be wary of leaving room at the bottom of the market for a competitor to introduce a 
low-feature, low-margin product that would give that competitor a foothold in the indus-
try. Furthermore, shifting all the customers out of the lower-priced versions and into the 
highest-price version may imply that the price of the highest-value version is too low. In 
these cases, the fi rm is likely leaving money on the table.
Inﬂ uences on a Versioning Strategy
To understand the value of versioning, we must look at the infl uences that give rise to a 
versioning strategy. These include marginal cost issues. However, in all markets, there are 
some interesting neuroeconomic and consumer behavioral issues that inform a versioning 
strategy or enable it to deliver higher profi ts than would be gained through an additive 
per-unit pricing strategy. 
MARGINAL COSTS
Versioning strategies have often been defended from a marginal cost standpoint. If the 
marginal cost of producing an enhanced version is less than that of producing individual 
products that can be added to each other to deliver the same benefi ts as the enhanced 
version, then versioning will be more profi table than producing individual items. Sub-
additive marginal costs contribute to the profi tability of versioning in two ways: (1) They 
lower the costs for the fi rm to deliver the same level of benefi ts and thus enable the 
fi rm to capture higher profi ts. Moreover, a pure profi t optimization argument based on 
downward-sloping demand curves indicates that the optimal price of the enhanced ver-
sion will be less than the sum of the optimal prices of individual products if they were 
produced and sold individually. Thus, (2) sub-additive marginal costs allow the price to 
decrease slightly while delivering the same level of benefi ts, thus increasing the demand 
for the product.
Sub-additive marginal costs are the primary driver behind versioning in information 
markets. For example, hard disk drive manufacturers fi nd it less expensive to produce 
a single hard disk drive with twice the storage capacity than to produce two individual 
hard disk drives. Likewise, software manufacturers face near-zero reproduction costs, but

Chapter 11 Versioning
non-zero marginal packaging and selling costs, and therefore they would often reap higher 
profi ts through versioning over add-on price strategies.
PROSPECT THEORY
Of the psychological effects that infl uence price structures, prospect theory looms large. As 
explored in an earlier chapter, prospect theory indicates that it is better to unbundle gains 
and bundle pains. In terms of versioning, the gains that customers receive are the many 
benefi ts delivered through the product. Higher-level versions deliver more benefi ts; lower-
level versions deliver fewer benefi ts. While all the benefi ts are bundled in a single product, 
the individual benefi ts can be isolated and highlighted during purchase decisions to en-
courage customers to select a higher-value product. With respect to the dictate of bundling 
pains, versioning bundles the pain of payment by asking customers to pay a single price 
for the litany of benefi ts rather than a separate price for each benefi t. In this way, prospect 
theory predicts that versioning strategies encourage customers to purchase a higher level 
of benefi ts than they would under itemized pricing, and therefore the fi rm can earn higher 
profi ts from versioning.
Three common techniques are used to highlight the gains and benefi ts in different ver-
sions. First, marketing communications often delineate the value points of the enhanced 
version compared to the base product to highlight the added benefi ts. Second, packaging 
often varies between the base product and the enhanced version to highlight the value dif-
ferential. Third, the product form factor can be differentiated between the base product 
and the enhanced version to clarify the value differential between the products visually. 
Combined, these and other techniques can effectively enable a fi rm to psychologically un-
bundle the gains in a versioning strategy to a similar level to the one they would have in 
an itemized pricing structure. Thus, when managed properly, both itemized and versioning 
structures unbundle gains equally well.
Versioning strategies dominate itemized price structures when it comes to bundling 
pain. With itemized pricing, each additional source of gain is clearly associated with an 
additional pain in the form of an additional price. The price increment in itemized pricing 
is explicit in the form of effectively asking customers if they want to pay price PA or price 
PA 1 PB. In contrast, a versioning strategy provides additional gain in an enhanced version 
while subsuming the pain in a new price. The price tradeoff in a versioning strategy comes in 
the form of asking customers if they would prefer to pay price PA or PTotal, where PTotal . PA. 
In a sense, the versioning strategy asks if customers would prefer one pain or another 
larger pain, while the add-ons strategy asks if they would prefer one pain or two. Prospect 
theory indicates that they would generally prefer one larger pain over two smaller pains 
that add up to the same total larger pain; hence, versioning strategies dominate over item-
ized pricing in bundling pains.
Because of the implications of prospect theory, it is possible that a versioning strategy 
could yield a higher total price on an enhanced version than that delivered by add-on pric-
ing from the sum of individual products. That is, if product Total delivers the sum benefi ts 
of products A and B, then prospect theory would predict that it is possible for PTotal to be 
greater than the sum of PA and PB. Research has yet to demonstrate that this conjecture is 
true, however.
EXTREME AVERSION
A well-understood effect in versioning is extreme aversion, an effect that arises from pros-
pect theory but has been specifi cally identifi ed with respect to the choices that customers 
make between competing versions. Given a good-better-best product lineup, customers 
tend to select the better version. While it may appear that the middle option offers the

best price-to-benefi ts tradeoff for the most customers, research indicates that the price-to-
benefi ts tradeoff is not the only driver. Instead, the tendency to choose the middle option 
rather than either the lowest or highest option is partially due to the aversion of customers 
to buying either the lowest- or highest-quality product.
Extreme aversion arises from loss aversion. Compared to a reference point, consumers 
are more averse to losses away from that reference point than they are gain-seeking to 
improvements to that reference point, as discussed with respect to prospect theory.4 The 
losses in benefi ts in moving from a middle version towards a lower-quality version will 
loom larger than the gains in savings by purchasing at a lower price; hence, humans may 
be averse to the lowest product within a lineup. At the other end of the product lineup, the 
losses in price paid in moving from a middle version towards a higher version may loom 
larger than the gains in benefi ts; hence, humans may also be averse to the highest-value 
product. The result is a tendency of customers to select a middle version or, alternatively 
stated, an aversion to extremes.
An early study that revealed extreme aversion was conducted with VCR sales. Since 
that early study, extreme aversion has become a standard vantage point for managing a 
versioning strategy. For instance, given that customers are averse to extremes, fi rms have 
an incentive to produce or market an extreme version at the top of a product lineup, even 
if they expect very few customers to purchase this product, if only to decrease the aversion 
and increase the purchases of an otherwise high-end product. 
Another method in which extreme aversion has informed versioning strategies is in the 
number of versions that a fi rm should produce. Generally, fi rms should make products 
at three or more different levels of benefi ts, rather than two or less, because of extreme 
aversion. With two or fewer versions, both versions are extremes, forcing customers to 
make careful tradeoffs between the two offers. With three or more, customers may feel 
safer knowing that they are choosing a middle version; thus, three or more versions may 
accelerate purchase decisions and increase sales. 
VERSION RANGE, ORDER, AND NUMBER EFFECTS
While cost savings may encourage fi rms to execute versioning, and extreme aversion may 
explain why many versioning strategies with three or more products might be superior 
to ones with two or fewer, these results only generate more questions. For instance, how 
many versions are too many? What is the proper range of versions? In what order should 
the versions be presented?
From a profi t maximization point of view, we have to acknowledge that each version 
comes with its own costs. Even if the marginal costs to produce different versions were 
zero, the marketing costs of defi ning, developing, and promoting an infi nite number of 
separate versions would soon become prohibitive. Hence, one limit to the proliferation of 
versions is simply cost. 
The number of versions is also limited by the need to enable customers to make quick 
and easy, yet meaningful, decisions. With too many versions, customers have diffi culty 
making tradeoffs to identify the product that is most likely to satisfy their desire for utility 
and a low price. Customer confusion can lead to delayed purchases, depressing overall 
demand. In online environments, marketers have noticed signifi cant improvements in sales 
when the number of versions offered at a time is reduced, rather than increased, even when 
the number offered is as little as two versus three at a time. When markets necessitate 
many different versions, fi rms must increase their expenditures on consultative selling and 
market communications to help customers through the decision-making process and iden-
tify the product that will deliver the best price-to-benefi ts for that customer.
Some studies have led to conclusions regarding the range of versions that a fi rm should 
offer as well.5 If the range of products available varies too widely, some research indicates

Chapter 11 Versioning
that customers may fi nd the offers hard to believe. Customers may believe that it is not 
possible for the fi rm to deliver suffi cient benefi ts in a single product at the top of the range 
to justify its price and simultaneously deliver anything of value at the bottom of the price 
range. These customers may be discouraged from all offers made and simply choose not 
to purchase. 
These range effect observations have led to a general prescription among restaurateurs 
to ensure that the highest-priced item within a section be no more than twice the price of 
the lowest-priced item in that section. While this prescription may be accurate for restau-
rants, it is also observed that many fi rms routinely offer products at a much wider range of 
prices. For instance, a fi rst-class cabin on an international fl ight might cost ten to twenty 
times the price of a coach fl ight. As such, any guideline to the maximum price range is 
likely to be industry- and market-specifi c. 
Rather than providing a prescription on the maximum allowable range, the range 
effect can indicate a needed action by executives when they believe it is depressing 
sales. If a fi rm notices that sales are depressed after releasing a new version at the top 
or bottom of the price range, executives could conclude that the range effect has been 
uncovered. To reverse this negative outcome, they may either drop a product at the ex-
treme or change the brand names of the products at one or the other extreme to distance 
the products further. Dow Corning executed this latter strategy with great results when 
launching the Xiameter brand in 2009 to reach a more price-sensitive segment while 
retaining the Dow Corning name for more utility- and service-sensitive customers in the 
silicone industry.
With respect to order, the experience of many salespeople and marketing executives 
has been supported by research that indicates that fi rms are usually better off when 
they present offers starting with the highest-priced product fi rst. Presenting products 
in descending order—that is, from the highest- to the lowest-priced product—tends 
to encourage customers to select a higher-priced product on average than presenting 
the same products in ascending order. There are situations where the order may be 
changed, such as a sudden decline in the economy and a need to demonstrate low-cost 
options to the market, but generally, fi rms should highlight the most-expensive item 
within the lineup.
DISCOUNTING AND CONSTANT, DIVERGENT, OR CONVERGENT PRICE 
DIFFERENTIALS 
When individual products within a versioning lineup are discounted, the price differ-
ences between the products will change. Changing price differentials between versions 
can infl uence customer choices regarding their desired version. Because the list prices 
of versions are usually optimized in relationship to each other, mismanaged discounts 
on one version can run amok with the profi ts earned on all versions within the product 
lineup. One approach to managing this potential challenge is to consider how a price 
discount affects the price differential between the versions. Specifi cally, executives can 
consider whether the discounting policy results in a constant, divergent, or convergent 
price differential. 
The challenge can be illustrated with a price waterfall with a simple two-version strat-
egy, a base product and an enhanced product, under the extreme consideration of zero 
marginal costs. Exhibit 11-4 shows simplifi ed price waterfalls within a versioning strategy 
under constant, divergent, and convergent price differentials. With constant price differen-
tials after discounting, both the base and enhanced versions receive the exact same mone-
tary value of discounting and thus the difference in the net price paid is the same as the list 
price differences. With divergent price differentials after discounting, the base product will 
be discounted more than the enhanced version, and thus the price differential between the

versions increases. With convergent price differentials after discounting, the base product 
will be discounted less than the enhanced version, and thus the price differential between 
the versions decreases. 
From the viewpoint that list prices were optimized with respect to customer tradeoffs 
initially, any discounts should leave price differentials constant. The price differential 
 defi ned by consumer utility while setting initial prices is a measure of the tradeoffs that 
customers make between price and benefi ts. Any divergence from these differentials will 
cause one product to cannibalize the sales of another product. 
If the price differential increases, the low price of the lower-value version will encour-
age new customers into the market while also taking sales from the higher-priced versions.

Chapter 11 Versioning
This cross-product cannibalization results from customers perceiving that they will gain 
a higher net utility after purchasing the lower-priced product than they would from pur-
chasing the higher-priced product. 
In contrast, if the price differential decreases, the price promotion will be successful 
at encouraging consumers to upgrade toward the higher-priced version, and yet it is 
less successful at expanding the market. However, by not increasing sales overall and 
only moving customers between product versions, the result may simply be an unneces-
sary price concession to customers who would have purchased a product anyway. The 
profi t damage from providing an unnecessary price concession to those customers who 
would have purchased the highest-priced product at its original list price is especially 
acute.
Differences in behavior between customers who typically purchase the lowest-priced 
product and those who seek the highest-priced product might suggest that price dif-
ferentials should diverge after discounting in a price waterfall. In a versioning strategy, 
the  highest-priced version typically targets more utility-sensitive customers, and the 
lowest-priced version targets more price-sensitive customers. Price discounts to utility-
sensitive customers may lead to brand switching, but they are unlikely to yield market 
expansion. Therefore, higher-priced versions may be subject to a policy of having smaller 
price discounts. In contrast, price discounts to price-sensitive customers are likely to yield 
both brand switching and the more-benefi cial aspect of market expansion. Hence, price
discounts may be more useful to industry profi ts overall when focused on the lowest-
priced products. 
Further research has demonstrated differences in advertising sensitivity between price- 
and utility-sensitive customers. Promotions in general are more likely to be noticed by 
a price-sensitive customer than a utility-sensitive customer. Hence, price promotions on 
the lowest-priced version both will be noticed more and will be more useful in captur-
ing price-sensitive customers. In contrast, price promotions on intermediate- and higher-
priced versions may not be noticed by the specifi c customers that they are targeting and 
may end up being no more than an unnecessary price concession. Supporting this conclu-
sion, research has shown asymmetry in promotions. Promotions on high-priced, high-
quality items tend to steal sales from low-priced, low-quality items, but the converse is 
not true.6
Finally, tertiary factors may drive executives towards a convergent price differential. 
For instance, if future sales depend on the initial version chosen and the revenue from 
these future sales is higher if a customer chooses the highest-priced version initially, 
then executives have an incentive initially to encourage most customers toward the 
highest-priced version through discounts. The future sales may take the form of an 
aftermarket add-on product or the form of a subscription service in which the sub-
scription price is set proportional to the list price without the initial discount. In either 
case, getting a customer into the higher-priced version may bring signifi cant economic 
benefi ts to the fi rm beyond the profi ts gained in the initial sale. To encourage custom-
ers to purchase the highest-priced version initially, executives may decide to discount 
the highest-priced version more than the lowest-priced version. The result would be 
a convergent price-to-benefi ts. In a convergent price-to-benefi ts discounting policy,
customers that are marginally considering upgrading will be further encouraged
towards a higher-priced version, while the fi rm will be seeking to recapture lost revenue 
through future sales.
Selecting the optimal price discounting pattern between a constant, divergent, or con-
vergent price differential clearly requires careful analysis. Consumer utility valuations 
imply that the price differentials optimized in setting the prices of the individual versions 
should be held constant. An analysis of consumer behavior in light of the market segments 
attracted to different versions would suggest a divergent price differential. In addition,

other factors, such as future sales tied to the initial version selection, could suggest a 
convergent price differential. Which of these effects should dominate a price discounting 
policy is subject to the specifi cs of the market challenge.
Mixed Versioning and Add-on Price Structures
Versioning can be used profi tably in conjunction with an add-on pricing structure. For
instance, let us reconsider the previously discussed examples of an add-on pricing struc-
ture. Nokia does not sell only one version of mobile handsets. Different handsets include 
different features, and customers can still add accessories to all the models. Likewise, 
BMW makes other models beyond the Z4, and the Z4 comes in different versions, such 
as the coupe.
Because feature-enhanced versions are targeted to utility-sensitive customers, and the 
profi t motive encourages the use of feature deprivation and enhancement as a segmen-
tation hedge between the utility- and price-sensitive segments, fi rms should offer more 
accessories at the top of the product lineup rather than the bottom. Feature-enhanced 
versions include many of the optional features available with feature-deprived versions, 
while also granting access to a wider variety of further enhancements. The number and 
type of features available increase as one moves towards the more-feature-enhanced 
version. This strategy has been well executed by Apple with its iPod, iPhone, and iPad 
product lines. Higher-valued versions of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad allow customers to 
purchase more media, more types of media such as movies and games, and even greater 
functionality. 
Selling accessories to different versions can be conceptualized as spider diagrams 
along the zone of indifference. See Exhibit 11-5. Moving up the zone of indifference, 
the versions improve from the feature-deprived version to the feature-enhanced ver-
sion as one moves from good to better to best. Concurrently, the number of add-ons 
increases as one moves from good to better to best. In the case shown in Exhibit 11-5, 
the good version cannot be customized with any optional features, the better version al-
lows customization with additional options of A and B, and the best version subsumes 
the option B into its product structure while allowing customization with options A, 
C, and D.

Chapter 11 Versioning
Summary
• In versioning, different variations of a similar product are sold simultaneously. 
Some versions offer more features or benefi ts, while others offer fewer features 
and benefi ts. As the product spectrum moves from feature-deprived to feature-
enhanced, the price likewise increases.
• Versioning strategies often follow a good-better-best progression. The good 
product is priced lowest and has the fewest features and benefi ts. The best product 
is priced the highest and has the most features and benefi ts. In between lies the 
better product, which is priced in the middle and loaded with a modicum of 
features and benefi ts.
• Versioning strategies have often been defended from a marginal cost standpoint. 
If the sum marginal cost of producing independent products is greater than the 
marginal cost of producing a product that delivers the same benefi ts, then the 
manufacturer will achieve greater profi t with a versioning strategy over an add-on 
strategy.
• According to prospect theory, it is better to unbundle gains and bundle pains. The 
many benefi ts delivered through the product are sources of gains. Each of these 
gains can be highlighted and isolated during a purchase decision to encourage 
customers to select a higher-value version. As to the dictate of bundling pains, 
versioning bundles the pain of payment by asking customers to pay a single price 
for the litany of benefi ts, rather than a separate price for each benefi t. In this way, 
versioning strategies encourage customers to purchase a higher level of benefi ts 
than they would under itemized pricing; therefore, the fi rm can earn higher profi ts 
from versioning.
• Extreme a version has been used to explain the tendency of customers to select the 
middle option within a versioning offering, and not necessarily because it delivers 
them the best utility for the price paid, but because consumers are simply averse to 
buying either the lowest-quality or highest-priced product.
• In managing a number of versions, executives must consider cost and psychological 
limitations to the number and range of products that they will offer. In general, 
fi rms should highlight the highest-priced version and present products in descending 
order. 
• The discounting policy in a version price structure should consider the effects that 
discounting one version may have on the sales of all other versions. Cross-product 
cannibalization, market-segment-dependent responses to discounts, and the 
potential for sales tied to the version selected all infl uence the optimal discounting 
policy in a versioning strategy.

can be described with a uniformly distributed taste parameter varying from 0 to 1. 
The fi rm produces two products: the base product A, at a variable cost of VA 5 $50, 
and an improved version with a variable cost of VT 5 $60. Assume zero fi xed costs. 
Let the base product be valued by the most-demanding customers at SA 5 $100 and 
the improved version be valued by the most-demanding customers at SB 5 $600. 
Assume that the least-demanding customers within the market assign no value to 
the product, S0 5 $0.

 f. If versioning the total product increased demand for that product by $5, such that 
the improved version was valued by the most-demanding customers at SB 5 $605, 
how would the results differ from these questions?
Economic Model of Versioning
Similar to add-on price structures, versioning price structures segment the market
according to different customers’ willingness to pay for different levels of benefi ts. As 
such, the economic model for versioning will be highly similar to that for add-on price 
structures.7 (See Appendix 10.) While the model that we demonstrate does not provide 
a general approach to pricing competing versions, nor does it indicate all the limita-
tions of versioning, the number of versions a fi rm should offer, or how one version 
should be defi ned compared to another, it does provide insight into the drivers behind a
successful versioning strategy. In particular, we uncover that the customer heterogeneity 
in their willingness to pay for enhanced benefi ts drives the profi t tradeoffs of expanding 
the market to lower price points while minimizing cannibalization of sales from the 
higher-quality version. 
As in Appendix 10, we will incorporate market heterogeneity in relationship to
benefi ts derived and willingness to pay with a taste parameter that varies from zero to 1

(t P [0, 1]). Customers with a low taste parameter (near zero) are those who value the 
product little and are not willing to pay much for the additional benefi ts that are pro-
vided through an upgraded version. Customers with a high taste parameter (near 1) are 
those who value quality improvements highly and have some willingness to pay for an 
upgraded version. 
We model customer preferences with a customer net utility function. As a minimal 
requirement for versioning, assume that the product can be made of two qualities at two 
different marginal costs. With two products, A and T, where T is the upgraded version of 
A, consumers have a utility function for A and another utility function for T. The net utility 
function is simply the difference between the utility that a customer derives from a product 
and the price they paid. Under these assumptions, the net utility function is given by the 
following pair of equations: 
U(t) 5 S0 1 SA ∙ t 2 PA if purchasing version A 
Eq. 11.1.a
U(t) 5 S0 1 ST ∙ t 2 PT if purchasing version T 
Eq. 11.1.b
where PA and PT are the price of products A and T, respectively; SA and ST are the maxi-
mum utility any customer can gain from products A and T, respectively; and t is our taste 
 parameter, which varies between zero and 1. In this model, we have assumed a zero-point 
utility of S0, with S0 being the value that all customers place on the product versions 
regardless of their taste parameter.8 If no purchase is made, we assume that customers 
neither gain nor lose utility—that is, that their utility function for not purchasing is zero. 
See Exhibit 11-6.
In a similar manner, as in Appendix 10, we will fi nd the taste parameters of the mar-
ginal customers. At the bottom end of the market, there are marginal customers who are 
indifferent between making no purchase and purchasing product A defi ned by the taste 
parameter t0,A. By setting Equation 11.1.a equal to zero, we fi nd

At the upper end of the market, there are marginal customers who are indifferent

not purchase. For t0,A # t , tA,T , customers purchase the base version A. For tA,T # t # 1, 
customers purchase the upgrade version T. As before, we will also assume a uniform dis-
tribution of taste parameter and a total market demand of Q.

 parameter must be less than 1. Using the equation defi ning the marginal upgrade customer,

Equation 11.4 indicates that the price of the upgraded version must be less than the price 
of the base version after adjusting for the quality gap (as valued by the most-eager custom-
ers, those with a taste parameter of 1.) By offering the upgrade version at a price lower 
than the quality-adjusted price of the base version, utility-sensitive customers will gain a 
higher net utility from the upgrade version than they would from the base version. 
For customers that purchase the basic version to exist, we know that their taste param-

Eq. 11.5
Equation 11.5 indicates that the basic version must offer a better quality-to-price ratio 
than the high-quality version. This second requirement comes from the need for the basic 
version to attract the more-price-sensitive customers. 
Having described the market and how customers make choices, we can turn to the 
challenge of maximizing the fi rm’s profi ts. The fi rm’s profi t equation in a versioning price 
structure is given by 
(PA, PT) 5 Q(tA,T 2 t0,A)(PA 2 VA) 1 Q(1 2 tA,T)(PT 2 VT) 
Eq. 11.6
where we have set fi xed costs equal to zero without losing generality. VA and VT are the 
variable costs of the base version A and upgrade version T, respectively. The fi rst term 
yields the profi t earned by selling the base product A. The second term yields the profi t 
earned from selling the upgrade version T.
Optimizing the prices directly from Equation 10.6 is a little diffi cult. To make the pro-
cess simpler, we will use a substitution of variables. Let us defi ne D to be the price differ-
ential between the upgrade product and the base product:
D ; PT 2 PA

In the fi rst part of the fi rm’s optimal profi t equation (Eq. 11.13), we see that the basic ver-
sion increases the fi rm’s profi ts by serving a broader market with a lower-priced product 
(market expansion). From the second part of the fi rm’s profi t equation, we also see that the 
profi ts earned from the upgraded version are reduced by the existence of the basic version.

version. Hence, the price of the basic version represents a compromise between the profi t-
destructive cannibalization of sales from the upgraded version and the profi t-creating 
market expansion by offering the core benefi ts at a lower price point.
The prices and profi ts earned in versioning are highly similar to those earned from an 
add-on price strategy. See Appendix 10 and Equations 10.9 and 10.14 for more detail. A 
notable exception is the inclusion of a zero point utility. Let us compare our price of the up-
graded version T to that of the base product A plus the add-on product B in Appendix 10, 
as well as the profi ts earned under versioning to that under an add-on strategy. To enable 
an equal comparison, let us assume that the zero point utility is zero (S0 5 0).
From a cost perspective, an upgraded version might have a lower variable cost of 
production than that of producing and marketing two different products, the base prod-
uct plus the add-on product. Let us defi ne V as the potential cost savings generated by 
packaging A and B into a single product versus selling them independently. In this case, 
the relationship between VT for the upgraded version and VA and VB in the add-on price 
strategy will be 
VT 5 VA 1 VB 2 V 
Eq. 11.14
Furthermore, consumer behavior and neuroeconomic effects, like those discussed with 
respect to prospect theory, indicate that an upgraded version might deliver a higher per-
ceived utility than the sale of two independent products, the base product and the add-on 
product. Let us defi ne S as the perceived gain in utility that customers receive from buy-
ing a single upgraded version over the utility that they receive from buying two products, 
the base plus its add-on. In this case, the relationship between the maximum potential 
utility of the upgraded version and that of the base product plus its add-on will be

where we have used Equations 10.9, 11.12.c, 11.14, and 11.15 with S0 5 0 to uncover 
Equation 11.16.
If there are no marginal cost savings (V 5 0), then the optimal price of the upgraded 
version can be higher than the sum price of the base product and its add-on. The increase 
in the optimal price of the upgraded version would be equal to half of the perceived 
increase in utility by bundling the two products into one rather than purchasing two 
separate products. Prospect theory predicts that the upgraded version may actually be 
perceived as having a higher utility (or at least less disutility in the form of the pain of 
payment) than the sale of two individual products, the base plus its add-on. Other effects 
may also indicate that customers have a higher utility from a packaged upgrade version 
compared to the sale of independent products. For instance, consider the willingness to 
pay for a table that must be assembled versus one that comes fully assembled. When com-
bining the parts into a single package does increase the utility, it is possible for versioning 
to result in a higher price for the upgraded version than the sum price of the base product 
and its add-on. That is, that PT . PA 1 PB. This is an intriguing result, especially in the 
situation where the utility increase derives solely from the effects discussed with respect 
to prospect theory. 
If there is no change in utility (S 5 0), then the optimal price of the upgraded version can 
be lower than the sum price of the base product plus its add-on. That is, that PT , PA 1 PB.

The decrease in the optimal price of the upgraded version would be equal to half of the 
marginal cost savings by bundling the two products into one rather than producing and 
marketing two separate products. When versioning reduces costs, as it would in producing 
a single hard drive at twice the capacity compared to selling two hard drives, optimal pricing 
would predict that a portion of these cost savings would be passed on to customers. 
If there are neither increases in utility nor savings in marginal costs in a versioning strat-
egy over an add-on strategy, or if these two effects exactly counterbalance one another, 
then the optimal price of the upgraded version will equal the sum price of the base product 
and its add-on. PT 5 PA 1 PB. Thus, versioning can result in optimal prices that are greater 
than, less than, or equal to those generated by an add-on price structure.
Comparing the fi rm’s profi ts earned under a versioning structure to those earned under 
an add-on structure, we fi nd that versioning can indeed be more profi table than itemized 
pricing. Writing the profi t equation under versioning in terms of the utility and marginal 
costs under an add-on structure, we fi nd

(We have assumed that S0 is zero to make the comparison between equations simpler.) The 
profi ts earned under versioning are greater than those earned in an add-on strategy. Com-
pare Equations 11.17 to 10.14. Versioning improves the profi ts captured on the upgraded 
product over those earned on the add-on product by an amount dependent on the increase 
in utility and decrease in marginal costs that result from producing and marketing a single 
upgraded version rather than having customers buy both the base product and add-on to 
deliver the same set of features.

one quality of a good under the conditions of zero marginal cost. Zero marginal costs are a common 
assumption in information markets. The zero-point utility might better be thought of as a secondary 
dimension of utility that all customers value equally, while the taste parameter defi nes the valuation 
difference that customers place on the key dimension of differentiation.

I
n general, bundling is a loosely applied term. However, in pricing, this term refers to a 
very specifi c situation. Price bundling, as discussed here and defi ned by many authors, 
specifi cally deals with the sale of two or more distinct products at a single, bundled 
price. By considering distinct products, bundling differs slightly from the prior discussions 
of add-on strategies and version pricing in that the distinct products themselves can be 
used in isolation or in combination. That is, each distinct product delivers value without

the use of the other products; and each of the distinct products within the bundle has its 
own individual market. In price bundling, the bundle price is below the sum of the indi-
vidual product prices but above that of any individual product alone. While this defi nition 
of bundling can be relaxed to address other situations, bundling as a pricing strategy has 
been best explored and is perhaps best applied under these conditions.
Price bundling is found in many contexts. Restaurants may offer a price-fi xed meal 
which includes appetizer, entree, and dessert. Any single item in the price-fi xed meal could 
be purchased in isolation, or all three could be purchased in a single sitting. The price-fi xed 
meal is priced below the sum price of the individual appetizer, entree, and dessert. Perhaps 
the best-known example of a variation on this theme is the McDonald’s Value Meal. Tele-
coms may offer a bundle of fi xed-line telephone service, high-speed Internet connection, 
television subscriber service, and mobile telephone service at a discount compared to the 
price of buying each of the services independently. Similar bundles have been offered by 
Vodafone, AT&T, O2, and several other fi rms around the world. Software fi rms may bun-
dle various offi ce productivity tools such as a word processor, spreadsheet, email manager, 
and presentation tool, with the most-famous example being Microsoft Offi ce. Similarly, 
sporting events and concert and dance series will offer bundles called season passes, which 
allows season-pass holders to attend multiple events rather than just one-off events. 
Price bundling is not the same as feature bundling (sometimes also referred to as prod-
uct bundling). In feature bundling, disparate features of and benefi ts of different products 
are combined into a single multifunctional product. Feature bundling delivers additional 
value over pure price bundling by combining multiple features of distinct products into 
a single bundled product. That is, the integral architecture of a feature bundle is itself a 
source of value. As such, customers would receive a higher value and fi rms can capture a 
higher price with a feature bundle than with a customer buying separate products. 
One example of feature bundling is Apple’s iPhone, which includes the features of a portable 
music device, mobile phone, and web browser in a single device. Customers could purchase 
each of these items separately, but by purchasing them in a single, combined product, they gain 
additional value. Moreover, a feature bundle may have lower marginal costs than separate item 
sales. With the iPhone, for instance, the production costs of separate mobile handsets, mobile 
web browsers, and mobile music devices would be greater than that for a single product. 
Other factors also infl uence the pricing and product strategy when creating a feature bundle, 
such as the effect of a feature bundle on competitive dynamics. When pricing a feature bundle, 
the price can be set according to the perceived value that consumers have for the collection of 
benefi ts plus the value of integrating these benefi ts into a single product. As we will discover, 
the optimal price of a price bundle is determined through a slightly different mechanism. 
Price Segmentation with Bundling
Price bundling is a strategy that benefi ts from heterogeneity in demand—specifi cally, de-
mand that is contrasting between products. Heterogeneity in demand implies that differ-
ent customers value different items differently. Contrasting demand heterogeneity implies 
that different customer segments will hold contrasting viewpoints on the value of specifi c 
items within the bundle. For example, consider a price bundle created from two different 
products. One segment of customers might value the fi rst product highly and the second 
product very little, while another segment will hold the polar opposite view, valuing the 
fi rst product little and the second product highly. In this case, we would state that the cus-
tomer segments hold contrasting demand.
The McDonald’s Value Meal is a familiar price bundle that can illustrate how price 
bundling works. To simplify this example, consider a McDonald’s Value Meal that con-
tains a burger and fries (ignore the drink for the purpose of this discussion) being offered 
to a market with two hypothetical market segments. The Burger Lover segment might be

satisfi ed with just a burger. The Fries Lover segment might be satisfi ed with just fries. In 
this example, the Burger Lovers and Fries Lovers have contrasting demand for burgers and 
fries. By selling both the burger and fries at a bundle discount, Burger Lovers are encour-
aged to enjoy fries, while Fries Lovers are encouraged to partake of a burger.
Contrasting demand between segments can be associated with many of the examples 
of price bundling. In the telecom industry, a savvy technology-oriented person might value 
mobiles and high-speed Internet service highly, while having little value for a fi xed-line 
telephone service or subscription television. In contrast, a more conservative customer 
may value fi xed-line telephony and subscription television highly, but have little value for 
mobiles and the Internet. Similarly, in the offi ce productivity software market, a fi nance 
customer may value spreadsheets highly, while a salesperson may value word-processing 
and presentation tools highly. 
Bundling exploits contrasting demand within the market for the different products by 
driving multiple segments to purchase more products than they would if the products 
were only available separately. If each product was priced individually to optimize its 
own independent profi tability, then the optimal price of the individual products would 
be set to capture the independent segments that value that product the most. In this case, 
the segment that doesn’t value one of the products very highly purchases only the specifi c 
products that it values and ignores the others. In a sense, bundling is a selective discount 
given preferentially to customers who value one item less than the other.
The price of the bundle should be lower than the sum price of the independently priced 
optimized products to encourage disparate customers with disparate independent product 
valuations to purchase all products in a single bundle, and it should be higher than the 
price of any specifi c product within the bundle to discourage cannibalization.
Price bundling improves profi tability by reducing the dispersion in the willingness to 
pay between the multiple customer segments. For instance, consider products A and B and 
customer segments Blue and Red. If the Blue segment desires product A at $5 and product 
B at $2, and the Red segment desires product B at $5 and product A at $2, then optimiz-
ing the prices of the individual products for their specifi c market segments might lead to 
pricing products A and B each at $5. However, a price bundle set at $7 would capture both 
segments. Moreover, it will do so by giving a selective discount to the specifi c segments 
proportionate to their willingness to pay. At $7, Blue customers will get a $3 discount on 
product B to encourage their purchase, but Red customers will not get a discount on B. 
However, that same price of $7 will give a $3 discount to Red customers on product A, 
but not to Blue customers. The price bundle reduces the dispersion in willingness to pay 
by acting as a selective price segmentation hedge between the different market segments, 
giving each a discount on the specifi c product that it values less. 
In general, the larger the number of goods bundled, the greater the reduction in disparity 
in willingness to pay. Because uncertainty about the value that customers place on a product 
is an enemy of effective pricing, the predictive power of bundling can be highly profi table.
Bundling also benefi ts from the psychological effects discussed in prospect theory.
Because the bundle price is lower than the sum price of the individual goods, the bundle 
price will be perceived as a discount in comparison. Discounts are an extra source of gain 
for customers. Hence, the bundle may improve sales even further than that predicted on a 
purely customer utility basis.
The bundle price appears as a discount on the sum price of the two individual products. 
However, it should not be treated as merely a discount when considering the analysis of 
the profi tability of bundling. That is, a standard analysis of volume hurdles in which the 
bundle discount is applied to one or the other product would fail to demonstrate the profi t-
creating power of price bundles. With price bundling, we must create a different bundle vol-
ume hurdle. Before we construct the bundle volume hurdle, let us demonstrate the strategic 
value of bundling. (The bundle volume hurdle can be found in Appendix 12.A.)

Strategic Bundling 
An example will best illustrate the effect of bundling on volumes, prices, and profi ts and 
can form the basis of a template for analyzing bundling in different situations. While price 
bundling can be found in many industries, we have chosen to use an opera house selling 
tickets to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Don Giovanni and Antonin Dvorak’s Rusalka. 
Both of these pieces premièred in Prague, Czech Republic, and are performed periodically 
at the Estates Theater in the Old Town Square section of the city. 
We will assume that the marginal cost of fi lling a seat at a theatre is negligible. Seating 
one more patron requires no further staff, and burdens the performers no further as well. 
Furthermore, once a theater is built, the number of seats is set; seating one more customer 
is virtually without cost so long as the performance is not sold out. Perhaps the only mar-
ginal costs faced by the theater are those associated with wear and tear on the facility or 
washroom usage, both of which should be minimal. This condition can easily be relaxed 
and marginal costs can be included in the model, but as a fi rst foray into bundling, we are 
striving to keep the scenario simple. 
As mentioned, price bundling exploits contrasting demand. For our opera house, let 
us assume that one segment of the market highly values the tragic opera Rusalka while 
the other segment highly values the comedic opera Don Giovanni. Let us furthermore 
assume the opera house could easily entertain both segments simultaneously.  We will as-
sign valuations for these operas for the disparate market segments and state that comedic 
opera seekers are willing to pay 1,500 CZK (Czech koruna) for Don Giovanni, but only 
700 CZK for Rusalka. Meanwhile, tragic opera seekers are willing to pay 1,500 CZK for 
Rusalka but only 700 CZK for Don Giovanni. See Exhibit 12-1 for a summary of the 
market segments and their willingness to pay.
In this two-segment case with ample seats for all potential customers, revenue is maxi-
mized, regardless of the size of individual segments, by offering the bundle at 2,200 CZK 
rather than offering either opera at its individual profi t-maximizing price. The 2,200 CZK 
bundle price tag arises from considering the minimum cross-segment willingness to pay 
for both operas. At 2,200 CZK, both segments will attend both operas. If the individual 
operas were offered at 1,500 CZK apiece and no bundle existed, patrons would attend 
one and only one of the two operas, and the opera house would forgo potential volume. 
Alternatively, pricing at a level of 700 CZK that would attract both segments, patrons 
would attend both operas, but at a lower overall price, and the opera house would forgo 
potential profi t.
The bundle price of 2,200 CZK is a discount from the sum of the higher individual 
prices at 3,000 CZK, but is at a premium compared to the sum of the lower individual 
prices at 1,400 CZK. Moreover, the bundle price at 2,200 CZK is attractive to both seg-
ments; thus, it captures the volume that would be lost if priced at the higher price and 
would be gained at the lower price. Hence, the bundled price improves volume sales com-
pared to the higher total price but captures a higher overall price compared to the lower 
total price. 
This simple example of a two-segment market with contrasting demand demonstrates 
the value of optimizing the price of the bundled offering compared to optimizing the 
price of the individual offerings. With only two segments, no marginal costs, and equally

opposing reservation prices, pure bundling is always more profi table than mixed bundling. 
In pure bundling, the individual products are not offered and only the bundled offering is 
made available. Effectively, pure bundling redefi nes the product. The individual products 
are subsumed into a new, larger bundled product and all price optimization issues shift 
towards managing the bundled price as the individual products cease to exist.
Markets with more than two segments or otherwise failing to meet the prior assumptions 
may benefi t from mixed bundling, rather than pure bundling. In mixed bundling, both the 
bundled offering and the independent offerings are made available to customers. We can 
build from our prior example to demonstrate the profi t impact of mixed bundling.
Let us expand our example to include two additional segments to demonstrate the 
value of mixed bundling compared to either pure bundling or an unbundled-only of-
fering. In this example, we assume that the Tragedy Lover and Comedy Lover segments 
still exist. We will further assume that we have two additional segments, one devoted to
Mozart and the other devoted to Dvorak. Furthermore, let us assume that each segment 
is of relatively equal size. (Though the assumption of relatively equal-sized market seg-
ments is not strictly required, we use it to overcome trivial cases of highly skewed mar-
kets.) Let the Mozart Devotees be willing to pay 1,600 CZK for Don Giovanni but only
100 CZK for Rusalka. Meanwhile, let the Dvorak Devotees be willing to pay 1,600 CZK 
for Rusalka but only 100 CZK for Don Giovanni. Again, these segments have contrasting 
demand for the products. See Exhibit 12-2 for a summary of the market segments and 
their willingness to pay.
In this four-segment case with ample seats for all potential customers, revenue is maxi-
mized by offering the bundle of both Don Giovanni and Rusalka at 2,200 CZK while 
offering the individual operas at 1,600 CZK each. At 2,200 CZK for the bundle, both 
Comedy Lovers and Tragedy Lovers will be enticed to attend both Don Giovanni and 
Rusalka because this bundle price is at their sum individual reservation prices. Meanwhile, 
2,200 CZK is above the sum reservation price of both Mozart Devotees and Dvorak 
Devotees to entice them to attend both operas. However, the individual price of 1,600 
CZK for a single opera is suffi ciently low to entice them to attend the specifi c opera that 
they desire.
The case for mixed bundling can easily be shown graphically in a plot of willingness 
to pay for differing products for the four-segment market. In Exhibit 12-3, we have plot-
ted along the vertical axis the reservation prices that different segments have for Don 
Giovanni. On the horizontal axis, we have plotted the reservation prices that different 
segments have for Rusalka. The arc of prices that heterogeneous segments are willing to 
pay extends farther from the origin for the bundled offering than it does for either of the 
independent products. As such, including the bundle in the menu of offerings improves 
profi tability compared to offering the independent products alone. 
Even in a two-segment market, where the willingness to pay is not evenly contrasting 
and market shares are unequal, a pure bundle can fail to be more profi table than either 
an unbundled or mixed-bundle pricing structure. For instance, consider a two-segment 
market with a small Tragedy Lover segment willing to pay 300 CZK for Don Giovanni 
but 1,700 CZK for Rusalka and a large Comedy Lover segment as described above. It can

be shown that the most-profi table pricing structure is to offer both Don Giovanni and 
Rusalka bundled at 2,200 CZK for the Comedy Lover segment, and Rusalka stand-alone 
tickets at 1,700 CZK for the Tragedy Lover segment. This instance effectively reverts to a 
versioning strategy.
In practice, mixed bundling is favored over versioning or add-on strategies under the 
following conditions: 
• Each product in the bundle has an independent market. 
• The markets for each product overlap. 
• The consumption of one product does not subtract from the value in consuming 
the other product. 
• The distribution of reservation prices between customers is broad and contrasting 
with respect to their desire for specifi c products. 
• The marginal costs to produce the products are low.
Various economists and marketers have devised different models to demonstrate the 
value of bundling.1 The specifi c models that they use vary in their generality and applica-
bility. In general, to demonstrate that mixed bundling is more profi table than versioning 
or add-on pricing strategies, one must show that three or more customer types with con-
trasting demand exist. 
A direct method to fi nd the optimal prices in bundling is through trial and error, as fol-
lows: (1) For inputs, executives must uncover the size of the various market segments and 
their willingness to pay for different products within the bundle. These may be discovered 
through conjoint analysis or other market research techniques. (2) Various price menus 
are created for the different individual products and the bundles. (3) With each price 
menu, researchers can calculate the anticipated consumer surplus for each market segment 
assuming that each segment self-selects the offer that delivers the highest surplus. (4) The 
revenues and profi ts are predicted against the specifi c price menu under consideration 
from the segment size and choices as well as estimates of marginal costs. (5) The price 
menu selected will be the one that optimizes profi ts. A robustness test can be conducted to 
account for variations in segment sizes and reservation prices.

Bundling
Bundle Design
MARGINAL COSTS
Price bundling is favored with products that have a low marginal cost of production. 
Bundling involves a discount over the sum price of the individual items. If the marginal 
cost to produce the individual items is signifi cant, bundling can be detrimental to profi ts 
because of the discount. 
One way to consider the profi t-increasing ability of bundling is in its ability to aggregate 
heterogeneous consumers into a single group. In aggregating customers with contrasting 
demand, the fi rm is reducing the dispersion of buyers’ valuations in the bundle compared 
to their valuations for individual products. However, if the marginal costs are large, the 
seller will usually want to increase, rather than decrease, the dispersion of valuations. 
Bundling involves a discount over the sum price of the individual items. If the mean 
marginal costs are higher than the mean valuation, bundling will decrease profi ts. If not, 
then bundling can increase profi ts.
Bundling became popular and underwent tremendous scrutiny with respect to digital 
goods. Digital goods, unlike tangible goods, have near-zero reproduction costs. Other 
 industries in which bundling dominates the pricing practices have a similar property of 
low marginal costs to reproduce, even though the cost to develop the product may be 
large, such as information, entertainment, intellectual property, and infrastructure-based 
products.2 Even high-fi xed-cost manufactured goods, such as silicon chips, may benefi t 
from bundling due to their very low marginal costs. 
Reviewing the examples of bundles that we have discussed so far, we see that the mar-
ginal cost condition holds. In each case, we can easily imagine that some customers would 
prefer certain products within the bundle while others would prefer other parts of the 
bundle; hence, the market would have contrasting demand heterogeneity. Moreover, they 
also meet the challenge of having low marginal costs; hence, the sales of more items, even 
at a lower bundled price, is likely to improve profi tability.
The price of food ingredients at a restaurant represents a small fraction of the overall 
cost structure. Rather, many of the costs in running a restaurant are somewhat fi xed in the 
form of space leases and staff pay, neither of which changes signifi cantly with the addition 
of one more customer.
Telecoms have large infrastructure costs but very low marginal costs. The cost of
adding one more service once the infrastructure has been established is often, though not 
always, zero or close to zero. 
Likewise, marginal costs in software have long been considered to be negligibly small. 
As a digital good, the costs are highly skewed towards the development of the product, 
not in its reproduction. A similar claim can often be made with respect to pharmaceuti-
cal offerings where the cost of manufacturing a dose is very low compared to the cost of 
developing new pharmaceutical regimens. 
Similarly, entertainment venues face high fi xed costs and low marginal costs. Once an 
entertainment event has been booked and the seats have been installed, the venue’s cost 
structure is highly fi xed and profi tability depends on the portion of the seats booked. If a 
seat if not booked, then adding a single further customer increases marginal costs negligi-
bly, while the sale of that seat improves profi tability directly. 
PROMOTIONAL BUNDLING AND BRAND SWITCHING
Accepting that bundling can improve profi ts by encouraging customers to purchase more 
items than they would have in absence of the bundle, the natural next question is the ori-
gin of these purchases. That is, does bundling encourage customers to purchase more from 
the category of items or to switch brands or retail outlets within the category? Put another

Bundling

way, bundling can infl uence both consumer choice (what to buy) and consumer incidence 
(how much to buy). For established market categories, retail sales data and academic 
experiments have been somewhat conclusive about this issue, and it appears that the
additional sales that occur due to bundle promotions arise from brand switching (infl uencing 
what to buy) more than category expansion (how much to buy).3 
For instance, retailer promotional bundling often comes in the form of “buy one, get 
one free” or “buy two and get $0.50 off.” It has been found that these types of bundles are 
strong at encouraging consumers to switch brands or retail outlets, but they are very limited 
at either encouraging consumers to accelerate buying (buying earlier and stocking up) or 
increasing category-level spending (buying more than what would usually be purchased). 
Even when customers fail to purchase the necessary quantity to qualify for the bundle 
discount, the bundle promotion is effective at encouraging sales, perhaps by creating the 
perception of being a low-priced outlet. 
Likewise, manufacturers face decision tradeoffs between price-promoting a single item 
or price-promoting a broader line of items with a promotional bundle. In examining the 
effectiveness of single-item versus bundling promotions, it has been found that promotional 
bundles tend to be more effective than per-unit promotions if the goal is to increase item or 
brand-line sales. As with retailer promotional bundling, the increase in sales comes primar-
ily from encouraging customers to switch brands within the category, not from increasing 
category sales to new customers. In other words, bundle promotions attract already heavy 
users from other brands, rather than covert nonusers or light users to heavy users. 
This ability of bundling to appeal selectively to heavy users over light users can have
dramatic effect on profi tability if heavy users are disproportionately responsible for
purchases, such as is found in beer sales. Attracting heavy users to select a manufacturer’s 
brand preferentially and converting these users into loyal customers can be a strong long-term 
profi t driver.
Further investigation into the effect of bundling on driving brand or retail-outlet 
switching has shown a leverage effect. According to the leverage effect, the savings that 
customers gain in a bundle for their preferred item is partially allocated to an increase in 
willingness to buy the other items in the bundle. Thus, the most-desired item in the bundle 
increases the preference of all items in the bundle compared to competing brands or out-
lets not in the bundle. If the aim is to increase sales of one specifi c item, it suffi ces to select 
only a few attractive items that can increase sales of the focal item through the leverage 
effect. The leverage effect partially explains the ability of bundling to induce brand switch-
ing between less-desired items within the bundle.
Brand betrayal limits the optimal size of a bundle. Brand betrayal implies that custom-
ers reject the brand that they would normally choose and switch to another brand instead. 
In bundling, brand betrayal can arise when customers perceive the quantity requirement 
on a bundle as being set too high so as to exclude most customers from the benefi ts of the 
bundle. Thus, the size of the potential bundle cannot be set too high, but it should be set 
high enough to infl uence heavy category users.
DISAGGREGATED SAVINGS IMPROVE BUNDLE SELECTION
Another area of investigation into the consumer response to bundling has indicated that 
bundling is more likely to engender a greater consumer response, or lift in sales, when the 
savings in a bundle are disaggregated. It’s a given that customers like savings. If the savings 
in a bundle are created in multiple parts, fi rst a savings on the individual items within the 
bundle and second by a savings on the bundle itself, customers are likely to perceive the 
savings as greater than if the savings were incorporated as a single lump sum.4
An investigation into luggage offerings led to this conclusion. Consider the sale of two

Chapter 12 
Bundling
Exhibit 12-4. There are three frames through which consumers could perceive savings if 
they bought both the garment bag and the Pullman: 
• Frame 1 The perceived savings are those of the bundle only ($178 2 $158 5 $20)
• Frame 2 The perceived savings on the items if purchased separately and additional 
savings on the bundle are perceived as two separate savings ($20 1 $20 5 $40)
• Frame 3 Savings on the items and the bundle are not perceived separately, but 
jointly ($198 2 $158 5 $40)
Research indicates that Frame 2 dominates. Separating the savings induces a higher 
likelihood to purchase than providing a single large-bundle discount.
This result fi ts with the notion from prospect theory that sellers should unbundle gains 
and bundle pains. Discounts are a form of gain in the sense that they provide a customer 
savings compared to the reference price. Offering two discounts, one on the individual 
items and a second on the total bundle, appeared to be more effective in encouraging 
 purchases than offering one single large-bundle discount.
Further research into manipulating the prices of the individual items compared to the 
bundle indicates that the additional savings offered directly on the bundle have a greater 
relative impact on buyers’ perceptions of transaction value than savings offered on the 
bundle’s individual items. 
BUYERS’ MENTAL ARITHMETIC OF BUNDLES
Bundling has also been examined with respect to buyers’ mental arithmetic. Mental arith-
metic concerns how customers evaluate the savings of a bundle—specifi cally, whether 
buyers associate the savings with the more-desired item within the bundle, or alternatively, 
associate the savings with the least-desired items within the bundle.
According to the reference-dependent model, customers will fi rst evaluate each item 
within the bundle and determine their willingness to pay, or reference price, for each 
specifi c item within the bundle, and then add up these reference prices to determine their 
willingness to pay for the bundle.5 In this approach, customers will associate most of the 
savings in a bundle with the least-desired item.
For instance, assume that a bundle offer consists of two products, each having a market 
price of $8, and that the consumer integrates the attributes of each product to establish 
a reference price of $8 for product A and $4 for product B. In this case, the offer to sell 
product A at $8 would have a net utility of zero, whereas the offer to sell product B at $8 
would have a negative utility of 2$4. If the two products are bundled at a price of $12, the 
reference-dependent model predicts that the valuation of the bundle will be higher when 
the discount is assigned to the product with a price reference below the market price. Thus, 
consumers will assign the discount to the less-valued product in the bundle.

The reference-dependent model was examined by asking which offer customers per-
ceived as more attractive: (1) Buy a large 1-topping Papa John’s pizza for $7.99 and get an 
order of 10 chicken wings for $3.99; or (2) Buy an order of 10 chicken wings for $7.99 
and get a large 1-topping Papa John’s pizza for $3.99. It was found that consumers who 
valued pizza more than chicken wings would fi nd the fi rst offer more attractive than the 
second, even though the economic effect is the same.
The reference-dependent model has positive implications with respect to bundling and 
marketing. It implies that most of the savings from the bundle are incorporated into a 
perceived savings on the least-preferred item within the bundle and thus would have little 
effect on resetting the expectation price of the most-desired item. This implication would 
be desirable from a price expectation management viewpoint. 
Unfortunately, early in the examination of consumer behavior with respect to bundling, 
it became apparent that the purely economic model of bundling gave an incomplete pic-
ture into how customers view a bundle. 6 From an economic viewpoint, we would expect 
that a customer’s willingness to pay for a bundle would be the sum of their willingness to 
pay for the individual items, similar to the reference-dependent model. However, several 
studies demonstrated that customers often failed to value the bundle at the sum price of 
the individual products, as they would according to the reference-dependent model.
A competing model of mental arithmetic with respect to bundling is the weighted-
additive model. According to the weighted-additive model, consumers evaluate a bundle 
starting at the most-preferred item within the bundle and work their way down to the 
least-preferred items. Moreover, the bundle savings would be perceived as savings on the 
most-preferred item.
 Customers may evaluate a bundle by fi rst anchoring their valuation of the bundle on 
the value that they place on the most-desired item within a bundle, and then adjust their 
valuation of the bundle to incorporate the other items within the bundle.7 Under the 
weighted-additive rule, it is believed that one of the items in the bundle will be more im-
portant to a consumer than the other items in the bundle. A consumer will scan a bundle 
to identify the most-important or focal product, evaluate this product at its offer price, 
and then evaluate additional products within the bundle and update the bundle valuation 
as he or she proceeds. The product that is most valued will receive the most-weight by 
consumers when evaluating the bundle. In other words, the overall bundle evaluation is 
determined by examining the items in decreasing order of their perceived importance and 
adjusting the bundle evaluation in the direction of the succeeding item evaluations.
For instance, consumers prefer to receive a discount on a liked magazine as opposed to 
a disliked magazine in a bundle of liked and disliked magazines. The liked magazine has 
more weight in the overall valuation of the bundle and, consequently, the discount of this 
liked magazine has more weight in the valuation of the bundle than the discount on the 
less-liked magazines. Consequently, most of the discount on the bundle will be perceived 
as a discount on the most-liked item within the bundle and will not be perceived as a dis-
count on the overall bundle or on the less-desired items within the bundle. 
Furthermore, consumers seem to fail to adjust their initial valuation of the bundle 
away from their initial anchor. That is, if the additional items in the bundle increased 
the value of the bundle compared to the preferred item, consumers would not increase 
their valuation of the bundle appropriately to refl ect their value of these additional 
items. The result would be that the bundle would routinely be undervalued by consum-
ers compared to their willingness to pay for individual items within the bundle, even if 
their willingness to pay for the individual items was less than the asking price for these 
items. Moreover, the bundle savings would be incorporated into a perceived savings on 
the most-preferred item, thus resetting the expectation price of the most-desired item in 
the bundle. Neither of these implications would be desirable from a price expectation 
management viewpoint.

Chapter 12 
Bundling
Which model is a more generally accurate description of mental arithmetic, the weighted-
additive or the reference-dependent model, is an area of active investigation. However, even 
without knowing which dominates, executives can use these insights to proactively manage 
the frame through which customers perceive an offer and achieve better results. 
For instance, in business markets, it is common for a purchasing agent to request a 
discount on a bundle of multiple items in one quarter and then expect that same discount 
to be applied to only the most-desired item in the next quarter. When purchasing agents 
execute this maneuver, one could claim that they are practicing a weighted-additive rule 
in evaluating the bundle by placing the majority of the savings on the most-desired item 
within the bundle. Sellers in this situation are advised to avoid this trap by explicitly iden-
tifying the savings in one quarter as coming from the less-desired items within the purchas-
ing order so as to not be cornered into providing a deep discount on the more-valued items 
in subsequent quarters.
LEGAL ISSUES
While bundling is generally a legally accepted practice, there are rare but notable instances 
in which bundling can have negative legal ramifi cations.8 The most notable cases in  recent 
history are those brought against Microsoft with respect to its choice of bundling various 
products with its Windows operating system and Internet browser. Bundling cases have 
also been brought forth in other industries, such as steel, rail, and even salt. Careful analy-
sis has led to a rough understanding of the legality of bundling, but case law is under 
constant revision and can be modifi ed with each new case.
The relevant law has been divided into the per se rule and the rule of reason. The spirit 
of both rules is that a bundling strategy should not harm consumers by limiting competi-
tion. Under the per se rule, bundling has been ruled illegal when it is (1) pure bundling 
(2) of separate products (3) by a fi rm with market power and (4) when a substantial 
amount of commerce is at stake. Under the more-stringent rule of reason, bundling has 
been ruled illegal under the same conditions as the per se rule if two further conditions 
exist: (5) the bundle poses a threat that the bundling fi rm will acquire additional market 
power over at least one of the products that is bundled with the tying product, and (6) no 
plausible consumer benefi ts offset the potential damage to competition.
As refl ected in these understandings, market power is one of the key issues with respect 
to price bundling. In competitive markets, almost all competitors are free to bundle. In 
markets with a high concentration of market share with any single fi rm, bundling is more 
likely to be legally suspect, even if that fi rm does not hold a complete monopoly. 
The second key issue is whether the bundle adds value to consumers or simply is used to 
block competitors. Strategic product bundling that effectively raises the barriers to entry into 
the market will tend to increase the market power of incumbents and thwart new entrants. If 
it can be shown that the bundle provides signifi cant customer advantages, courts may allow 
it. If not, executives should evaluate actions to mitigate the legal risks of bundling.
The specifi c examples of bundling that have been discussed in this chapter are un-
likely to raise any legal challenges because they focus on mixed bundling rather than pure 
 bundling and assume highly competitive industries. 
Tradeoﬀ s in Add-on, Version, and Bundle Pricing
Each of the three pricing structures, add-ons, versions, and bundles, takes advantage of 
heterogeneity in customer willingness to pay to defi ne price segments and improve prof-
itability. However, each pricing strategy is favored under a different set of conditions. 
Executives should consider their market, specifi cally the demand drivers of their market, 
before selecting one approach over the other.

However, the primary driver to determining whether a fi rm should select an add-on, 
versioning, or bundling strategy is customer heterogeneity. Markets with high hetero-
geneity in demand and multiple dimensions of demand heterogeneity tend to favor 
add-on pricing strategies, wherein customers can select a base product and customize 
their product with various complementary add-on products. Markets in which the het-
erogeneity in demand can be modeled along a single dimension, wherein a base product 
is increasingly enhanced to produce higher-benefi t and higher-priced versions, favor 
versioning. Markets in which the heterogeneity in demand can be modeled as contrasting, 
wherein some customers prefer the fi rst set of products, other customers prefer the 
second set of products, and all product benefi ts are additive for all customers, favor 
bundling strategies. 
The second key driver to selecting an add-on, versioning, or bundling strategy is the 
cost structure. In an add-on pricing strategy, each individual complementary product is 
priced independently, and no specifi c product would be marketed unless some customers 
were willing to pay a price higher than the marginal cost to produce. Likewise, versioning 
strategies can manage increases in marginal costs as the product is enhanced in features 
up to the point that some customers are willing to pay signifi cantly more for the enhanced 
features than the marginal costs to produce the product with those features. In this way, 
marginal costs affect the profi tability of versioning strategies in something of the same 
proportion as they affect the profi tability of add-on strategies. In contrast, high marginal 
costs signifi cantly discourage a bundling strategy because the bundled price is often much 
lower than the sum price of the individual products. With high marginal costs, fi rms 
usually desire to disaggregate market segments according to their willingness to pay for 
specifi c products rather than aggregate them into a single bundled segment.
There are other, more nuanced factors that infl uence the selection between an add-on, 
version, or bundling price structure. For instance, consider the interplay between prospect 
theory and price structure. Add-on price structures require customers to pay a separate 
price for each additional product; yet prospect theory encourages marketers to bundle 
pain and unbundle gain. As such, prospect theory would predict that the demand for ad-
ditional products would be dampened compared to their underlying economic trading ca-
pacity because each additional product brings additional pain, in the form of price, along 
with the additional benefi ts. In contrast, versioning strategies bundle the pain into a single, 
albeit higher, price for customers to capture additional benefi ts. Finally, bundling strategies 
are highly favored by prospect theory because they not only deliver more benefi ts to cus-
tomers, but are structured so as to bring a new additional benefi t in the form of a discount 
compared to the sum of the individual product prices. 
We have summarized the effects of market heterogeneity, cost structures, and pros-
pect theory on the selection of add-on, versioning, or bundling price structures in

Chapter 12 
Bundling
Summary
• In bundling, two or more distinct products are sold at a single, bundled price. The 
bundled price is lower than the sum price of the individual products, but higher 
than the price of any individual product within the bundle.
• Bundling exploits contrasting demand within the market, wherein some customers 
prefer one item within the bundle more than the second, while others prefer the 
second item in the bundle more than the fi rst. The bundle aggregates these two 
customers into a single segment, one that would prefer to pay the bundle price for 
receiving both products rather than a single lower price for only one item in the 
bundle.
• Bundling is favored by products with low marginal costs.
• In mixed bundling, both the individual products and the bundle of the products 
are marketed. In pure bundling, the individual products are not marketed, only the 
bundle. Pure bundling represents the equivalent of redefi ning the product category.
• Bundling is more effective at encouraging brand or retail outlet switching than at 
encouraging increased consumption or accelerated purchasing. 
• Bundling strategies benefi t from the leverage effect, wherein the most-desired item 
in the bundle increases the preference for all items in the bundle compared to 
competing brands.
• Promotional bundling is more effective at creating consumer interest if the savings 
are disaggregated; that is, the savings of the bundle are identifi ed as both a savings 
on the individual items and an additional savings on the purchase of the entire 
bundle. 
• Consumers’ mental arithmetic regarding bundling varies between different frames. 
In some cases, it is believed that customers associate the bundle savings with the 
least-preferred item (reference-dependent rule) in the bundle. In other cases, it is 
believed that customers associate the bundle savings with the most-preferred item 
(weighted-additive rule). 
• Bundling has come under legal restrictions when used primarily as a competitive 
tactic by dominant fi rms.

Promotional Bundle Volume Hurdle
In Chapter 2, we investigated the sensitivity to profi ts earned from a single product with 
respect to a change in its price and developed a volume hurdle. The volume hurdle identifi ed 
the level of sales required for price discount to increase profi tability. In this appendix, we will 
develop a different volume hurdle—the volume hurdle for promotional bundling. 
With promotional bundling, we are no longer selling a single item, but rather two items. If 
we attempted to apply the same rules created for discounting a single item to discounting a 
bundle of items, we would quickly fi nd challenges. One of the larger of these would be iden-
tifying the portion of the discount that should be ascribed to each individual product. Rather 
than trying to resolve this challenge, we will derive a different bundling volume hurdle.
The bundle volume hurdle can be derived through identifying the required increase in 
sales generated from selling a bundle at a discount compared to selling individual items. This 
is a quantifi able question that can be derived directly from the fi rm’s profi t equation.
First, let us look at the fi rm’s profi t equation in the absence of bundling. Assume that the 
fi rm is selling two products, product A and product B. We fi nd the fi rm’s profi ts to be 
p (individual) 5 QA  (PA 2 VA) 1 QB  (PB 2 VB) 
Eq. 12.1
where we have assumed no fi xed costs without losing generality to make the derivation 
simpler. QA and QB are the volume of sales of products A and B, respectively, in the ab-
sence of bundling. PA and PB are the prices of products A and B, respectively, and VA and 
VB are the variable costs of products A and B, respectively.
In bundling, the sales volumes of the individual items within the bundle and the sales 
of the bundle itself will be different than in the absence of bundling. There can be four 
different ways in which the bundle affects sales:
 1. The bundle can take sales away from customers that would have bought A but 
not B. These are customers that are upgrading their purchase from that of A alone 
to that of the bundle. Let the change of volume from these customers be denoted 
by DQA→T . DQA→T takes sales from A but adds them to the bundle.
 2. The bundle can take sales away from customers that would have bought B but 
not A. These are customers that are upgrading their purchase from that of B alone 
to that of the bundle. Let the change of volume from these customers be denoted 
by DQB→T . DQB→T takes sales from B but adds them to the bundle.
 3. The bundle can take sales away from customers that would have bought both A 
and B. In this case, the bundle is a pure price concession to this customer segment. 
Let the change of volume from these customers be denoted by DQAB→T . DQAB→T 
takes sales from A and B but adds them to the bundle.
 4. The bundle can create some new customers that would not have purchased either A 
or B. Let the change of volume from these customers be denoted by DQnew . DQnew 
adds sales to the bundle but has no effect on the sales of A or B. 
In the presence of a promotional bundle, the fi rm’s profi t equation becomes
p (bundle) 5  (QA 2 DQA→T 2 DQAB→T)  (PA 2 VA)
1 (QB 2 DQB→T 2 DQAB→T) ? (PB 2 VB)

earned from the bundle, under the condition of a promotional bundle. We have assumed 
that there are no changes in variable costs associated with promotional bundling because 
the promotional bundle simply takes two individual items that were on the market and 
sells them at a new, bundled price. We have also introduced a new term, dPT , which is the 
price discount of the bundle compared to the sum price of the individual items.
The bundle volume hurdle is identifi ed by requiring the profi ts earned under the bundle 
promotion to be greater than what would be earned compared to individual product sales 
alone. Alternatively stated, we desire the change in profi ts to be higher:
Dp 5 p (bundle) 2 p (individual) . 0 
Eq. 12.3
We can defi ne the contribution margins CMA and CMB for products A and B, respectively, 
to be 
CMA 5 PA 2 VA 
Eq. 12.4.a
CMB 5 PB 2 VB 
Eq. 12.4.b
Then, using Equations 12.1 and 12.2 for the profi ts earned under individual sales and a 
bundle promotion into the condition for improved profi tability in Equation 12.3 along 
with the substitutions of 12.4, we fi nd
(DQA→T 1 DQB→T 1 DQAB→T 1 DQnew)  (CMA 1 CMB 2 dPT)
 2 (DQA→T 1 DQAB→T)  CMA 2 (DQB→T 1 DQAB→T)  CMB . 0 
Eq. 12.5
Equation 12.5 contains the quantities that defi ne the anticipated sales from the bundle 
and the loss of sales from the individual products. To make these changes explicit, let us 
defi ne the change in volumes DQA and DQB of products A and B, respectively, as 
DQA 5 DQA→T 1 DQAB→T 
Eq. 12.6.a
DQB 5 DQB→T 1 DQAB→T 
Eq. 12.6.b
and also defi ne the sales of the product bundle, DQT , as 
DQT 5 DQA→T 1 DQB→T 1 DQAB→T 1 DQnew 
Eq. 12.6.c
Using the defi nitions in Equation 12.6 and our condition in Equation 12.5 and solving 
for the required sales from the bundle, we fi nd the promotional bundle volume hurdle of 
DQT .  CMA ? DQA 1 CMB ? DQB 
 
 
_______________________ 
 
CMA 1 CMB 2 dPT
 
 
Eq. 12.7
Each term on the left side of Equation 12.7 can be estimated prior to executing a promotional 
bundle. The contribution margins CMA and CMB can be calculated for the individual products 
and this does not change the presence of a promotional bundle. Similarly, the discount of the 
promotional bundle compared to the prices of the individual products, dPT , will be determined 
in the design of the promotion. Prior to the promotional bundle, the change in sales of A and 
B, expressed as DQA and DQB, can be estimated to develop an understanding of the required 
bundle volume hurdle. After the promotional bundle has been executed, the cannibalization
of sales can be measured and the sales of the bundle, DQT can be compared to the hurdle in 
Equation 12.7 to determine whether the bundle improved profi ts or damaged them.
Just as with standard volume hurdles for single-item discounts, executives can use 
the bundle volume hurdle to determine whether a bundle discount improved or harmed 
profi ts, and to forecast whether a bundle will add or subtract to profi tability.

Economic Model of Bundling
Economic research into bundling has focused on creating abstract models to demonstrate 
the conditions under which bundling is more profi table than the absence of bundling.9 
While the model does not provide a general approach to pricing a bundle, it can be used 
to defi ne the requirements of bundling and explains how bundling improves profi ts under 
certain circumstances. The model will be highly similar to that used in exploring the eco-
nomics of add-on and versioning price structures to enable easy comparison. One driver 
in particular is important: some customers must have contrasting demand between the 
items in the bundle.
We will assume that the optimal prices of the independent products are unchanged 
under bundling. While this is an overly restrictive assumption, we can still demonstrate 
the power of bundling under this restriction. This assumption is true in many cases. For 
instance, consider a fi rm that has optimized the prices of independent products for inde-
pendent markets and is considering launching a new bundled product containing many of 
the individual products. In this case, it may be unlikely that the fi rm will change the prices 
of the individual products simply by launching a new bundled offer.
For the few customers QT , with contrasting demand for products A and B, the net 
utility function is given by the following set of equations:
U(t) 5 SA  t 2 PA 
if purchasing product A 
Eq. 12.8a
U(t) 5 SB  (1 2 t) 2 PB 
if purchasing product B 
Eq. 12.8b 
U(t) 5 SA  t 1 SB  (1 2 t) 2 PT 
if purchasing bundle T of A and B 
Eq. 12.8c 
where we have defi ned SA and SB as the maximum value that any of these customers will 
place on products A and B, respectively; and PA, PB, and PT are the prices of the individual 
products A and B and the price of the bundle T.
We have once again used a taste parameter (t) to account for the heterogeneity in de-
mand between different market segments. (See Appendix 6 for more about this.) The taste 
parameter varies between zero and 1 (t [ [0, 1]). Customers with a low taste parameter 
(near zero) are those who value the product A little but value product B highly. Customers 
with a high taste parameter (near 1) are those who value the product A highly but value 
product B very little. In this way, the taste parameter accounts for the contrasting demand 
for these QT customers. For simplicity, we will assume a uniform distribution in the cus-
tomer taste parameters within this segment. As the value for product A increases, the value 
for product B decreases. See Exhibit 12-6.
In a similar manner as before, we fi nd marginal customers with contrasting demands. In 
this case, we have two marginal customers: One is indifferent between purchasing product 
A alone and purchasing the bundle (tA,T); the other is indifferent between purchasing  product B 
alone and purchasing the bundle (tB,T). We assume that customers of all types exist, thus 
0 # tB,T # tA,T # 1. When 0 # t , tB,T , the customer purchases only B. When tB,T # t # tA,T  , 
the customer purchases the bundle T, which includes both products A and B. When 
tA,T , t # 1, the customer purchases only A.
From our utility function 12.8a and 12.8c, the customers indifferent between buying 
A alone and the bundle T will have equal utility for purchasing either A or the bundle T:
SA  tA,T 2 PA 5 SA  tA,T 1 SB  (1 2 tA,T) 2 PT 
Eq. 12.9
Solving for tA,T, we fi nd
tA,T 5 1 2   PT 2 PA

Similarly, from our utility function 12.8b and 12.8c, the customers indifferent between 
buying B alone and the bundle T will have equal utility for purchasing either B or the bundle T:

Eq. 12.12
For customers to make a tradeoff between the bundled products and the independent 
product A, we know that tA,T must be less than 1. Similarly, for customers to make a trade-
off between the bundled products and the independent product B, we know that tB,T must 
be greater than zero. These conditions imply that 
tA,T # 1 ⇒ PT $ PA 
Eq. 12.13.a
tB,T $ 0 ⇒ PT $ PB 
Eq. 12.13.b
Equation 12.13 indicates that the price of the bundle must be greater than the price of 
either product if some customers are to purchase an independent product while others 
choose the bundle. 
We also know that some customers will choose the bundle. For these customers to exist, 
the taste parameter of those choosing between product B and the bundle must be less than 
that of the customers choosing between product A and the bundle. This implies

for these customers with contrasting demand is given by

where we have defi ned VA and VB be the marginal cost of products A and B, respectively,

Using the results of Equations 12.10, 12.12, and 12.17 in Equation 12.16 and simplifying

The optimal bundle price represents the individual product prices, adjusted for the mar-
ginal cost savings in bundling, minus the product of the utilities divided by the sum of the 
utilities. This optimal bundle price is less than what it would be in the absence of selling 
the individual products.
At this price, we in turn look at the restriction on costs. We fi nd the bundle cost has to 
be less than the utility-weighted average costs of the individual parts plus the product of 
the utilities divided by the sum of the utilities:

The cost of bundling will often meet the condition set in Equation 12.20. As such, bundling 
is likely to improve the profi tability of the fi rm. We leave it to the reader to identify the 
profi t increment resulting from this economic model. As noted in this chapter, we suggest
fi nding the optimal price of a bundle and its profi t impact through simpler models that simply
consider segment sizes and their willingness to pay for different products.

business profi les, and other research-oriented journals. Book clubs, music clubs, gyms, 
and other organizations have also long used subscription pricing. The list of industries in 
which someone can fi nd subscription-based pricing is continually growing.
More recently, there has been a proliferation of Application Service Provider (ASP) 
and Software as a Service (SaaS) price structures for enterprise applications.2 These pric-
ing models have not only made signifi cant inroads into the market, but they have also 
expanded the market for enterprise software to include small and medium-sized busi-
nesses. In these pricing models, software fi rms sell access to their software using subscrip-
tion pricing rather than one-off sales followed by periodic update and upgrade sales, or 
maintenance and service contracts. 
Many fi rms profi t from subscription arrangements due to their ability to reduce the 
transaction costs. With digital goods delivered electronically, the costs of reproduction 
may be negligible; but the administrative costs of managing transactions can be signifi cant. 
Through subscription offerings, transaction costs can be reduced, thus improving the prof-
itability of the fi rm and potentially reducing the costs to access the digital good. As a result, 
the market is expanded. Even in non-digital markets, transaction costs can be reduced 
through subscription arrangements. 
In a subscription arrangement, a series of related individual purchases is converted into 
a single purchase decision. For instance, rather than purchasing individual issues of a pe-
riodical or individual visits to a gym, the subscription enables the customers to receive a 
number of issues or multiple visits through a single transaction. Even when payments are 
spread out over time, the subscription model reduces the decision to enter into the purchase 
agreement to a single point rather than requiring the customers to decide to purchase each 
time they want to receive the item. The items in the subscription can vary as well; with soft-
ware, for example, the subscription will include not only the license to use the software, but 
also access to updates and service to ensure that the software is functioning. Sometimes it 
also includes data hosting and management when sold as a complete service.
Subscriptions also can separate the timing of the payment from that of consumption. 
In some cases, the payment may be made through a periodic lump sum that covers many 
episodes of consumption, such as yearly newspaper subscriptions and daily delivery. In 
other cases, the payment may be concurrent to the time of usage, such as membership 
contracts that cover a year and require monthly payments and allow customers access to 
the product continually during that year.
In pricing the subscription relative to the sale of the individual items, there are two key 
 metrics. The fi rst is the total period price or the sum price that customers would pay if they pur-
chased all the items within the subscription. This is the maximum price that can be charged for 
the subscription in absence of a signifi cant change in the value proposition. The second is the 
customer period value, or the sum price that the customer would pay during the period given 
average customer purchasing patterns. The customer period value sets the minimum price for 
the subscription that the fi rm should offer. Any price below this level would leave the fi rm 
worse off than if it had simply offered all its products for sale through individual purchases.
Moderating the price between these two levels set by the total period price and cus-
tomer period value are issues related to consumer behavior and changes in the value prop-
osition. For numerous reasons, fi rms fi nd it relatively impossible to charge subscription 
prices equal to the total period price. However, this should not imply that subscription 
prices should equal the lower, expected customer period value. Subscription prices typi-
cally are signifi cantly higher than the expected period value due to increases in the total 
benefi ts that customers gain through the subscription arrangement relative to individual 
item purchases. Further complicating subscription price structures are changes to the value 
proposition. For instance, with many software subscription services, fi rms not only offer 
customers access to the software, maintenance, and support, but they also assume respon-
sibility for hosting and managing the data. This represents an increase in the economic 
value delivered to customers, thus further enabling higher prices.

Pricing the Subscription
When considering adding subscription sales to individual product sales, the fi rm should 
ensure that it will be more profi table with subscriptions than it is with individual product 
sales at a minimum. To ensure this, we would expect the price of the subscription to lie 
between two boundaries. See Exhibit 13-1. The upper bound is defi ned by the total period 
price, or the price that customers would pay if they purchased every item in the subscrip-
tion. The lower bound is defi ned through the expected customer period value. 
The method of calculating the customer period value is extremely similar to that of the 
customer lifetime value. While relatively simple to execute, an analysis of the customer 
period or lifetime value requires careful identifi cation of a number of factors. Let us 
examine a common practice in calculating these two price boundaries before we turn to 
infl uences in determining the appropriate price between these boundaries.3
TOTAL PERIOD PRICE
The total period price is simply the price that customers would pay if they purchased every 
item within the subscription. It is the maximum price that customers would consider paying.
For instance, a monthly magazine with a newsstand price of $3.95 would have a total 
period price for one year of $47.40. See Exhibit 13-1. Likewise, gym visitors paying $10 
per visit to use the gym three times a week for 52 weeks might expect a total period price 
for annual gym use of $1,560.
Even when the individual items within the subscription are different, the total period 
price is the sum of the individual unit prices. For instance, a basic enterprise software 
subscription might include the license to use the software coupled with maintenance and 
support to provide access to critical software updates and disaster recovery support. Other 
services may also be added to a software subscription, such as data hosting and manage-
ment. In this case, the total period price is the sum of the price of the software license, 
maintenance and support, and data hosting and management.

Chapter 13 
Subscriptions and Customer Lifetime Value
To build a model of the total period price for enterprise software, suppose that the initial 
software license fee is $325,000, and that maintenance and support is priced at 18 percent 
of the initial license fee. Then, a fi ve-year subscription to the software would have a total 
period price of $617,500, which includes both the price of the initial license and ongoing 
maintenance and support. On a monthly basis, the total period price of the subscription 
would be $10,292, neglecting any effects from the timing of payments.
Firms rarely price subscriptions at the total period price, however. While the potential 
exchange value is the total period price, subscription prices much lower than this total 
period price are often more profi table than selling the units individually. In calculating 
the total period price, we have assumed that customers would buy every unit during 
the period and furthermore, that they would remain customers throughout the period 
under consideration. Customers rarely behave this way. Even dedicated customers of 
a product cannot be expected to purchase every unit. The total period price leaves the 
most-demanding customer indifferent between purchasing the individual products on 
the spot market and purchasing the subscription. Given the drawbacks of subscriptions, 
such as the pre-commitment to the future consumption of a good that may or may not 
be demanded in the future, customers lack any incentive to purchase the product on a 
subscription basis if the subscription price equals the total period price. As such, fi rms 
usually fi nd it more profi table to price subscriptions below the potential total period price 
in the absence of a change in the value proposition. 
CUSTOMER PERIOD VALUE 
The customer period value calculates the expected profi ts earned from a customer dur-
ing the period, given a customer’s actual purchase behavior. By calculating the customer 
period value, we can identify the minimum price that the fi rm should consider charging 
for a subscription.
The largest conceptual differences between the customer period value and the total 
period price are the inclusion of factors that refl ect actual customer behavior. For instance, 
it is not uncommon for customers to purchase a few issues of a magazine or visit the gym 
a few times prior to ending their relationship with the product. As such, customer reten-
tion rates become a key factor in analyzing the expected profi tability of a customer and 
therefore the minimum price to charge for a subscription. 
A refi nement to evaluating the profi tability of customers is the timing of payments. 
Though analytically taxing yet conceptually obvious, the timing of payments differs be-
tween customers purchasing a series of individual products on the spot market and cus-
tomers purchasing a subscription. To manage this difference, calculations of customer 
period values include discount factors relating to the time value of money to the fi rm.
Another refi nement to evaluating the profi tability of customers refl ects differences in mar-
keting costs. In analyzing the marginal profi t of a customer transaction, at fi rst glance one 
would take the difference of the price paid and the variable costs to produce. However, such a 
simplifi ed analysis overlooks the marketing costs outlaid to capture and retain that customer. 
As such, models of customer period value are substantially more accurate when they discrimi-
nate between costs related to customer acquisition and those related to customer retention. 
It requires signifi cantly more effort to capture a new customer than to retain an existing 
customer. In many industries, customer acquisition costs are fi ve to ten times the customer 
retention costs. Detailed accounting of marketing expenditures allocated between the two 
efforts is required to produce an accurate refl ection for specifi c fi rms. 
Hence, for a basic model of customer period value, four issues must be resolved: (1) The 
individual prices and variable costs for each item within the series of products in the sub-
scription must be identifi ed. (2) The customer retention rate must be identifi ed. The customer 
retention rate is a measure of the likelihood that a customer who purchases an individual

item will also purchase the next item within a series of products in the subscription. (3) The 
timing of the payments and the applicable discount rate are required to put the subscription 
payments and series of individual payments on an equal fi nancial footing. (4) The marketing 
costs must be allocated between customer acquisition and customer retention. 
To demonstrate the calculation of a customer period value, we can return to the chal-
lenge of pricing a twelve-month magazine subscription. The minimum subscription price 
that the fi rm should accept would be that which leaves the fi rm equally well off between 
customers who choose the subscription and those who purchase at the newsstand. Hence, 
we need to calculate the customer period value for a customer who purchases individual 
items at the newsstand, and uncover the subscription price that leaves the customer period 
value unchanged when a customer enters into a subscription relationship with the fi rm 
versus purchasing the products at the newsstand. 
Let us fi rst evaluate the profi tability of a customer who purchases the magazine at the 
newsstand. Let the price of each issue made available at the newsstand be $3.95 and let 
the costs to produce and distribute be $1.45 to both newsstand customers and subscribers. 
Let the customer retention rate (r) be 80 percent, meaning that 80 percent of the customers 
who purchase the fi rst issue decide to purchase the second issue, and 80 percent of those 
choose to purchase the third issue, leaving us with only 64 percent of the original customer 
base (80 percent  80 percent 5 64 percent). We can repeat this calculation for subsequent 
periods. Let the discount rate be 11 percent, corresponding to a monthly discount rate (d) 
of 0.873 percent.4 Finally, let the marketing expenses be allocated such that, on average 
per customer, $1.25 is spent on acquiring new readers and $0.125 is spent on retaining 
existing readers. (In many industries, it is not uncommon for initial customer acquisition 
costs to exceed the initial customer contribution margin.) In this case, the customer period 
value for the twelve months following the acquisition of a new reader can be calculated to 
be $9.64. See Exhibit 13-2 for details of the calculation.

Subscriptions and Customer Lifetime Value
In setting the minimum acceptable subscription price, we seek to ensure that an average 
customer is at least as profi table when he or she enters into a subscription as when pur-
chasing the magazine at the newsstand. If we assume that the subscription is paid with the 
fi rst issue, we can fi nd the minimum subscription price by taking the difference between 
the customer period value of purchasing at the newsstand and the customer period value 
of a subscription provided for free. 
As before, for the subscription the costs to produce and distribute are $1.45, the cus-
tomer acquisition costs are $1.25, and the annual discount rate is 11 percent. In the case 
of a subscriber, the customer retention rate during the period of the subscription can 
be set at 100 percent if cancellations are not allowed. In this case, the customer period 
value of a subscription provided for free is a loss of $17.84. See Exhibit 13-3 for details 
of the calculation. Hence, any subscription price greater than $27.48 5 $9.64 1 $17.84 
would leave the fi rm better off than it would be on average by selling the magazines 
solely through the newsstand. This is the price determined from the customer period 
value used in Exhibit 13-1.
We can adjust the model of customer period value to include further refi nements in as-
sumptions. Common refi nements include allowing for changes in cost structures between 
selling a series of individual items and selling a single subscription. If we want to include 
customers who pick and choose which items they purchase within the series or customers 
who stop and restart a subscription, the overall approach to the calculation is not terri-
bly dissimilar but does require more complex modeling. Doing so would not change the 
overall conceptual approach to evaluating the customer period value, but it would add a 
layer of complexity. We leave this exercise to readers, applied to the specifi c business that 
they are managing.

Subscriptions and Customer Lifetime Value

Customer Lifetime Value 
The magazine subscription example demonstrated the value of understanding the cus-
tomer period value. If we expand this analysis to include further periods, such as the entire 
lifetime of the customer interaction with the fi rm, we would be calculating the customer 
lifetime value.5 The spreadsheet method used previously for calculating the customer pe-
riod value for magazines is straightforward, but simpler methods can be derived using a 
few tools from some more-advanced mathematics. 
Customer lifetime values infl uence pricing decisions in many areas outside of sub-
scriptions. Many times, fi rms make an initial sale at a loss in the hopes of earning profi ts 
on the sale of subsequent items. For instance, consider tying arrangements. The sale of 
razor handles may be subsidized by the expected profi ts on the sale of future razors; the 
sale of printers may be subsidized by the profi ts earned on the future sale of ink; and 
the sale of game consoles may be subsidized by the profi ts earned on the future sales of 
gaming titles. 
We have seen that a number of factors infl uence an analysis of the lifetime profi tability 
of a customer, and that fi nancial issues such as the price paid, costs to produce, timing of 
payments, and discount rate all directly affect the profi tability of a customer. Furthermore, 
we have observed that customer behavior factors and marketing efforts to infl uence cus-
tomer behavior also affect the profi tability of a customer, such as the customer retention 
rate and customer acquisition and retention costs. 
The expected customer period value is a sum of the profi ts earned from that cus-
tomer during each purchase after discounted back to the present value and including 
the probability that a customer will make a future purchase. Mathematically, we can 
write this as
CPV 5 (Pi 2 Vi 2 A) 1  ∑ 
n52
 
N
  (Ps 2 Vs 2 R) r n21  
 
________________ 
 
 (1 1 d) n21  
 
Eq. 13.1
The fi rst term, Pi 2 Vi 2 A, is the profi tability of the fi rst sale, where Pi is the price 
paid, Vi is the variable costs of the initial item purchased, and A is the allocated cus-
tomer acquisition marketing cost. The second term is a sum over the period of future 
sales of the profi ts earned discounted back to the present value, where S means to take 
the sum of the term to the left as the period variable n goes from 2, the fi rst period of 
purchasing a subsequent item, to N, the last period in the subscription. (For example, 
a twelve-month subscription would use an N of 12.) Ps 2 Vs 2 R is the profi ts earned 
of the subsequent sales when all subsequent sales are of the same product, where Ps is 
the price paid, Vs is the variable cost of the subsequent items purchased, and R is the 
allocated customer retention marketing costs. In the numerator of the second term, the 
term of r n]1 is included to account for the probability that a customer will actually pur-
chase in the future, where r is the period customer retention rate. The term (1 1 d)n]1 
in the denominator of the second term is the familiar discount factor using the period 
discount rate d. 
When the future purchases of a customer are relatively similar and the marketing 
expenses on customer retention are expected to be somewhat constant, we can create a 
generalized algebraic formula for calculating the customer lifetime value that includes all 
these factors. Using a property of converging sums, we can rewrite Equation 13.1 for the 
customer period value to

Equation 13.2 has the advantage over Equation 13.1 of being a completely algebraic 
 formula that can be easily calculated. 
If we are not considering a simple period of customer purchases but rather the entire

where we have used CLV rather than CPV to highlight the inclusion of the overall

Behavioral Eﬀ ects with Subscriptions 
The previous quantitative analysis of the total period price and customer period value 
price has narrowed the uncertainty in pricing a subscription. The subscription price should 
be less than the total period price if it is to attract customers into the subscription arrange-
ment; hence, it would be less than $47.40 in the magazine example. Also, the subscription 
price should be higher than that which would leave the customer period value unchanged 
if it is to improve the profi tability of the fi rm; hence, it should be above $27.48 in the 
magazine example. Within this range, subscription prices are infl uenced by a number of 
qualitative behavioral effects.
MARKET SEGMENTATION 
Within the market for a series of products, there will be natural market heterogeneity or 
differences in the preferences of customers. Some customers would prefer to consume 
all products within series, while others would prefer to choose the products that they 
purchase.6
If customers can predict their future demand, those who suspect that their total 
period purchases will be above the subscription price would rationally choose the 
subscription. Meanwhile, variety seekers who suspect that their total period purchases 
will be below the subscription price would choose to purchase the individual items 
that they want. In this case, the subscription price represents a discount to more-loyal 
customers.
Differences in market segments regarding the desire of customers to purchase the entire 
series of products should encourage fi rms to price the subscription at a price higher than 
that which would be predicted by considerations of the average customer loyalty alone. 
Effectively, those who would purchase the subscription are also signaling their product 
loyalty and can be anticipated to have a higher retention rate. Customers with a higher 
retention rate also have a higher customer period value. As the customer period value 
increases, so too does the minimum subscription price, which improves the profi tability 
of the fi rm.
Because the retention rate of customers who purchase the subscription is higher than 
that of customers who select individual products, a fi rm can charge subscribers a higher 
price than it would for the average customer in the market. Hence, subscription prices 
are usually higher than that determined by equilibrating the customer period values 
alone.
LOCK-IN 
When customers subscribe to a series of products, they become locked into an arrange-
ment with the supplier. Many customers are aware of the value of pre-committing their

purchases to suppliers. However, customers suffer from uncertainty about their ability to 
predict their future demand. They also value the ability to abandon a supplier relationship 
in the future if that supplier fails to deliver the expected set of benefi ts. Because of the 
negative impact that lock-in presents to customers, the subscription price must be below 
the total period price to induce customers to purchase. 
INCREASED CONSUMPTION PATTERNS
With some subscription offerings, customers tend to consume more of the product than 
they otherwise would. One reason for this increased consumption is that once the cus-
tomer has entered into the subscription arrangement, future consumption of the product 
comes with a zero or otherwise low marginal price. For instance, research has shown that 
magazine subscribers typically read more articles than customers who buy the magazines 
at the newsstand. Another factor that increases consumption is the ability of subscription 
offerings to address a market failure arising from information asymmetries. 
Many products sold through a subscription suffer from information asymmetries be-
tween buyer and seller. Information goods are notoriously experience goods. Prior to the 
consumption of an information good, such as reading a magazine, listening to song, or 
accessing a database, buyers have little knowledge of the value of consuming the infor-
mation. Meanwhile, sellers of information goods have better knowledge of the value of 
their information, and as such will rationally seek to capture a higher price. This leaves 
an informational asymmetry for many subscription goods between sellers, who know the 
value of their offerings, and buyers, who do not.
The subscription offering helps reduce market failures in the face of informational 
asymmetry by reducing risks faced by the customer. When customers subscribe to a maga-
zine, they do not know the future contents of all the magazines that they will receive, and 
therefore they cannot a priori know the value of any individual issue. While customers 
may be unable to determine the value that they will derive from any individual item within 
the subscription, they can anticipate that their overall utility from the series of offerings 
will be greater than the overall subscription price. Hence, the subscription reduces the risk 
that buyers will stop reading the magazine because they purchase a specifi c issue that they 
fi nd unsatisfactory. 
The effect of reducing information asymmetry through subscriptions is one of increas-
ing overall demand for the subscription in relation to the sale of individual units. Thus, 
the volume of issues sold should be higher for a fi rm that sells units both individually and 
through subscriptions, than for a fi rm that offers the product only through individual 
unit sales. Moreover, the price of the subscription can be somewhat higher than that 
determined by considerations of the customer period value alone.
Overestimation Bias 
When customers are choosing between a subscription membership and a pay-for-use offer, 
they sometimes fall subject to an overestimation bias of their positive future behavior.7 
For example, people join gyms in the hope that they will exercise more, an activity that 
contributes positively to their quantity and quality of life. Unfortunately, customers are 
poor predictors of their own future behavior. Many times, customers will join the gym, 
attend a few times, and then fail to return to the gym even though their gym membership 
is still active. This is an example of an overestimation bias: Humans tend to overestimate 
their own future positive behavior.
In studies of actual purchases and behaviors, it was found that customers of gyms that 
purchase a monthly membership paid on average 70 percent more than they would under

Subscriptions and Customer Lifetime Value
a pay-as-you-go arrangement, and moreover 80 percent of the monthly subscribers would 
have been better off had they paid per visit for the same number of visits. These observa-
tions lead to the understanding that customers overestimate their future effi ciency; that is, 
they overestimate their ability to perform desirable tasks such as health club attendance 
or, alternatively, to consciously switch contracts to the type of arrangement that would 
provide the greatest economic benefi t.
As an extension of the overestimation bias, researchers have also examined differ-
ent subscription payment arrangements and the likelihood that a customer will renew 
the membership. It was found that the timing of payments affects consumer behavior 
when monthly or frequent payments encourage use, and they may also encourage higher 
 customer retention. Gym customers selected between a monthly contract with monthly 
payments and an annual contract with annual payments. While all customers were likely 
to overestimate their usage of the gym facility regardless of the contract they selected, 
those who selected the monthly contract were more likely to use the gym more frequently 
and renew their membership. 
This has led to the understanding that, in subscription offerings in which customers are 
subject to an overestimation bias of their future positive behavior, concurrence of usage 
and subscription payment leads to longer memberships and therefore a potentially higher 
profi tability. 
Value Proposition Changes and SaaS
In many cases, the benefi ts delivered through a subscription arrangement are greater than 
those delivered on a pay-per-item basis. For instance, magazine subscriptions often include 
other items positioned as gifts, such as a book, reference guide, or other token of appre-
ciation. Similarly, gyms will often provide a “free” T-shirt or other gift to new members. 
These gifts are usually provided without increasing the price of the subscription due to 
their inconsequential nature. However, other subscription offerings do include specifi c 
items and benefi ts that are substantially consequential to the customers and are not of-
fered directly by the supplier for separate purchase. When the value proposition changes 
signifi cantly between the subscription offering and that of the sale of individual products, 
fi rms have the opportunity to increase the subscription price to that of a premium offer 
as well.
SAAS
With Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings in enterprise software, the benefi ts delivered 
through the subscription are substantially more valuable, and the variable costs to serve 
are also higher. SaaS offerings include not only the license to use the software, but also the 
management of the software and the customer’s data itself. The inclusion of managing a 
customer’s data not only increases the benefi ts to the customer but also increases the costs 
to the provider. As such, fi rms marketing SaaS have sought to increase the price of their 
offering over that of the total period price of the software alone.
These fi rms have found that selling SaaS at a premium over that of the software alone 
met stiff customer resistance. Some of the reasons that customers would eschew paying 
a premium for a subscription service have already been mentioned, such as the lock-in 
effect and natural market segmentation based on expected future demand. Yet perhaps 
one of the larger reasons is that SaaS may not convincingly deliver greater value than the 
software alone.
The benefi ts of SaaS are signifi cantly higher than those of a straight software license, 
but it is uncertain that these benefi ts necessarily accrue to the customer’s balance sheet. 
Companies purchasing SaaS avoid costs related to increased computing power and data

storage, increased manpower for managing the data, and increased technical training to 
manage the enterprise software. Unfortunately, many of these cost savings are incremental 
and may be inconsequential from the customer’s frame of reference. 
For instance, an enterprise customer that purchases software may perceive that its in-
formation technology (IT) staff can manage the product without any change in staffi ng 
requirements. If the SaaS arrangement does not actually reduce the customer’s staff, it is 
diffi cult to state convincingly that it delivers labor cost savings. Only in the aggregate of 
several SaaS contracts may an enterprise customer realize any tangible labor cost savings. 
Similar arguments are often made with respect to the costs of managing the software and 
computing requirements. 
Despite the added benefi ts of providing SaaS, the uncertainty in the realization of these 
benefi ts, coupled with the overall behavioral effects that suppress subscription prices, 
makes it diffi cult for enterprise software fi rms to realize a signifi cant premium on their 
SaaS offerings. Even when fi rms are unable to fully realize higher prices on SaaS, they 
may benefi t from other behavioral effects of subscription services such as higher customer 
retention rates that improve the customer overall lifetime value. 
As more enterprise software providers adapt SaaS offerings, it can be expected 
that enterprise customers will come to accept higher premiums for SaaS over that of 
the sale of software licenses and maintenance and service contracts due to the abil-
ity of customers to begin realizing the potential costs savings generated through SaaS 
offerings. 
EXAMPLE: QUICKBOOKS 
We can see some of the challenges of SaaS through examining a well-known fi rm that is 
using this arrangement. In 2009, Intuit offered both QuickBooks Simple Start and Quick-
Books Online Basic.8 Simple Start is a product sale, designed to have customer renewals 
at the end of each year. Online Basic is sold through an SaaS model and is positioned by 
Intuit as comparable to QuickBooks Simple Start but with a few added benefi ts. 
As with other SaaS models, Online Basic provided customers with secure online data 
management accessible through any Internet browser, freeing them from the responsibility 
of installing the software, storing data, and managing data backup and recovery plans. 
Online Basic also granted customers the right to expanded email support services. Similar 
support services were provided to Simple Start users only at a premium. Online Basic also 
allowed customers to cancel their contract at any time.
In terms of pricing, Simple Start had a list price of $99.95 for new customers, while renew-
ing customers received a $20 discount. Meanwhile, Online Basic was sold for a fl at rate of 
$9.95 per month. From a total period pricing perspective, Online Basic was priced at a small 
premium compared to Simple Start. Over a twelve-month period, a Simple Start customer 
would pay a total price of $119.40. Such a small premium can be justifi ed on the basis that 
Online Basic does provide a few added benefi ts. However, the small size of the premium also 
highlights the challenges in capturing the value of providing the added benefi ts of SaaS.
On a customer period value basis, an Online Basic subscriber may have been less profi t-
able than a Simple Start customer in the fi rst year. To compare the customer period value 
of a Simple Start customer to that of an Online Basic subscriber, we need to quantify busi-
ness factors related to the customer period value.
First, the revenue from an Online Basic subscriber is spread out over time and future 
payments should be discounted back to the present time. We will use an annual discount 
rate of 6 percent to incorporate the costs associated with spreading out payments over 
time. This corresponds to a monthly discount rate of 0.487 percent.
Second, the variable cost structures for Online Basic subscribers may be higher than that 
for Simple Start customers. Simple Start is available through a digital download; hence it

would have negligible costs of reproduction. Let us use a value of $0 for the variable costs 
in delivering Simple Start. In contrast, the added features of Online Basic over Simple Start 
increase the costs to serve. Let us use a value of $1.50 per month for the variable costs as-
sociated with the increased customer service coupled with the provision of data storage, 
management, and online access for Online Basic. 
Third, let us assume that the marketing costs are similar across both products. More-
over, it is strongly suspected that most of Intuit’s marketing efforts are focused on captur-
ing new customers rather than retaining existing customers. Hence, let us use a value of 
$20 per customer to represent the customer acquisition costs, and $2 per customer per 
year ($0.167 5 $212 per month) to represent the customer retention costs.
Finally, Intuit faces unique challenges in retaining small business customers. Even if 
Intuit has highly dedicated customers, the churn in business establishments is signifi cant 
as companies get started and go out of business. Let us use a customer retention rate of 
75 percent per year, which corresponds to a monthly retention rate of 97.6 percent.9
Under these assumptions, the fi rst-year value of a Simple Start customer is $79.95, or 
the difference between the price paid and the customer acquisition costs. See Exhibit 13-4. 
For the overall customer lifetime, the value of a Simple Start customer increases to the 
more-signifi cant value of $268.54. 
Using the values listed above and Equation 13-2, we fi nd the customer period value of 
an Online Basic customer for the fi rst year is only $65.41. Hence, Simple Start customers 
are potentially more profi table than Online Basic customers in the fi rst year, despite the 
fact that Online Basic customers pay a higher total period price. The higher profi tability of 
Simple Start customers found in this analysis is a result of incorporating the higher costs 
to serve Online Basic customers. 
When we examine the overall customer lifetime, we fi nd that under these assumptions, 
the total value of an Online Basic subscriber is $271.65. The increase in value of an Online 
Basic customer relative to a Simple Start customer found in considering the overall customer 
lifetime is largely due to the lower renewal price offered to Simple Start customers.
From this analysis, we see that over the customer’s overall lifetime, an Online Basic cus-
tomer appears to be as valuable as a Simple Start customer. However, we have not taken into 
account other factors related to consumer behavior. Online customers may be more likely 
to stay with Intuit and thus have a higher retention rate, which improves their profi tability.
We have also seen the challenges presented in profi tably offering SaaS are non-
negligible. The fact that SaaS subscribers may be able to cancel their subscription at any

time, coupled with the higher costs to serve, drives fi rms to raise SaaS prices above that of 
the equivalent total period price when they seek to make SaaS subscribers equally profi t-
able to other customers.
Summary
• Subscriptions convert the sale of a series of related individual purchases into a 
single purchase decision. The timing of payments in a subscription can be separated 
from the timing of consumption. Although subscriptions are often paid at the time 
of entering into the contract, payments can be spread out over the course of the 
subscription period.
• Two key quantitative metrics can guide subscription pricing decisions. 
Subscriptions should be priced below the total period price paid, or the price 
that customers would pay if they purchased every item in the subscription. 
Subscriptions should be priced higher than that price that leaves the fi rm equally 
profi table with respect to customer period value.
• The customer period value is quantitatively determined by the net contribution 
that a customer makes with each purchase during the period of time under 
consideration, the marketing costs associated with customer acquisition and 
retention, the discount value to incorporate the time value of cash, and the 
retention rate. 
• The customer lifetime value is simply the customer period value over the lifetime of 
the customer relationship.
• Subscription offerings are infl uenced by numerous consumer behavioral effects. 
Most notably, subscriptions can act to segment the market between those who 
anticipate consuming all the individual products and those who anticipate 
consuming only a small portion of the overall offerings. 
• The lock-in effect can suppress the potential price of a subscription in relation to 
the total period price.
• Customers who subscribe to a series of offerings usually increase their 
consumption compared to what they would have consumed if they purchased the 
items individually. For instance, magazine subscribers typically read more articles 
than customers who buy magazines at the newsstand. 
• In information markets, subscriptions address a market failure created by 
information asymmetries. Information goods are, by nature, experience goods. 
Sellers of information goods have better knowledge of the value of the information 
that they hold than buyers do. As such, buyers have a diffi cult time evaluating the 
value of, and therefore their willingness to pay for, information goods. By selling 
information through a subscription rather than individually, the risk to buyers is 
reduced, so their demand increases.
• In some markets, customers are subject to an overestimation bias of their own 
future behavior. For instance, in fi tness markets, many annual subscribers fail to 
utilize their gym subscription and would actually be better off purchasing access on 
a per-visit basis. 
• With SaaS, the value proposition is signifi cantly enhanced over that of the outright 
sale of the software license and maintenance and service agreements. The provider 
both manages the software and its updates and hosts the customer’s data. It is 
possible to charge a premium price of SaaS based on economic arguments alone; 
however, customers have shown resistance to this, which may be due to an inability 
to capture the full benefi ts of SaaS offerings.

 3. WebEx, an online meeting and teleconference service, is sold on a per-use basis or 
through an annual subscription. For small online meetings of three people or less, 
WebEx charges $95.40 for a one-hour online meeting including teleconferencing. 
Consider a WebEx customer segment interested in holding a small online meeting 
once per month. Assume that the cost borne by WebEx for teleconferencing for a 
small meeting is $36 per meeting. Let the monthly discount rate be 0.7974 percent. 
 a. What is the total period price of purchasing a one-hour online meeting with 
WebEx if a customer purchases it twelve times per year?
 b. For a non-subscribing customer, assume the marketing expenses are allocated 
such that, on average per customer, $5 is allocated for acquiring new customers 
and $0.50 is allocated for retaining existing customers. Furthermore, let the 
effective retention rate be 75 percent between meetings. What is the one-year 
customer period value of a non-subscribing user?
 c. For subscribers, assume the marketing expenses are allocated such that, on average 
per customer, $5 is allocated to acquiring new customers and nothing is spent on 
retaining existing customers. Furthermore, let the effective retention rate be 
100 percent between meetings for subscribers. What subscription price would 
leave the customer period value for a subscriber equal to that of a non-subscriber?
 d. From this analysis alone, what range of prices would you expect to see for an 
annual subscription to WebEx?
 e. WebEx advertises an annual subscription at $708. Does this price lie within the 
range predicted from this analysis? 
 f. Repeat this analysis considering a customer segment that typically has a low 
retention rate, only 20 percent. How much more profi table is it for WebEx to 
convert a low-retention customer into a subscribing customer than to let that 
customer simply purchase WebEx as needed? 
 4. The Financial Times (FT) is sold at the newsstand for $2 per issue. For 52 weeks 
per year, the FT prints 6 issues per week. Assume the cost to produce and distribute 
the FT is $0.75 to both newsstand customers and subscribers. Let the applied 
discount rate be 0.03055 percent for the inter-issue period.
 a. How many issues per year does the FT produce?
 b. What is the total period price of purchasing every issue of the FT published that 
year at the newsstand?
 c. For newsstand readers, assume that the marketing expenses be allocated such 
that, on average per customer, $0.10 is allocated for both acquiring new readers 
and retaining existing readers. Furthermore, let the effective reader retention 
rate be 99 percent between issues. What is the one-year customer period value 
of a newsstand reader?
 d. For subscribers, assume that the marketing expenses be allocated such that, on 
average per customer, $20 is allocated to acquiring new readers and nothing is 
spent on retaining existing readers. Furthermore, assume that the retention rate 
of subscribers is 100 percent over the course of one year. What subscription 
price would leave the customer period value for a subscriber equal to that of a 
newsstand reader?
 e. From this analysis alone, what range of prices would you expect to see for an 
annual subscription to the FT?
 f. The FT offers an annual subscription at $99. Does this price lie within the range 
predicted from this analysis? If not, how would you account for the difference? 
Hint: Consider the effect of two-sided markets on subscription prices.

3 Most academic research has treated subscription-based offerings as a bundle of individual products or as one 
part of a two-part tariff; yet it fails to undertake the task of guiding an executive in pricing a subscription. 
The approach presented here differs for the following reasons: (1) offers made in a subscription include 
products that are not purchased and consumed at the same time, unlike most product bundles; 
(2) decisions in pricing subscriptions may have access to information not available to those of bundling, 
such as customer retention rates; and (3) many products sold through subscriptions are subject to specifi c 
behavioral effects, such as information asymmetry, that change the nature of the purchasing decision. For a

A
lmost all consumers who have purchased an airline ticket in the past twenty years 
will have noticed that they can expect to pay a lower price if they purchase the 
ticket earlier rather than later. Yield management, also known as revenue man-
agement, is a pricing structure that drives prices higher as the time of use of the product 
approaches. In yield management, the seller attempts to maximize the profi ts it earns on 
selling a resource by changing the price of the product over time.
Yield management is one of many dynamic pricing techniques.1 In yield management, 
the price offered to customers increases as capacity approaches exhaustion. It is a technique

Chapter 14 Yield Management
for maximizing the expected revenue earned on a fi xed-capacity resource by selling units of 
that capacity at different prices. It uses timing and expectations of demand as a means to 
price-segment the market. It is a probabilistic pricing technique that relies on probability-
weighted demand expectations to determine the availability of fare classes, each of which 
has a different price. 
The practice of yield management expands beyond the airline industry and can be 
used in a number of industries. From an internal operations perspective, there are four 
key determinants for using yield management: (1) Capacity is limited and perishable.
(2) Customers will reserve units of capacity ahead of time. (3) The fi rm can sell that
resource at a variety of prices, also known as fare classes, each of which has a fi xed price. 
(4) The fi rm can change the availability of the predefi ned fare classes over time.
We can see each of these issues with respect to the airline industry. The capacity on a 
specifi c fl ight is inherently limited. Adding more seats on a specifi c fl ight either requires 
changing the plane used or adding a further fl ight. Furthermore, once the fl ight departs, 
a seat unsold on that fl ight cannot be fi lled in the future. The potential revenue from that 
seat is forever lost, and the value of that seat on that plane on that fl ight perishes forever. 
Because both customers and the airline are well aware that capacity on any given fl ight is 
limited, customers regularly will book a seat on a plane ahead of time to assure its avail-
ability. Outside of versioning, wherein airlines sell fi rst-, business-, and coach-class travel, 
airlines are also able to create a variety of fare classes within each section. Each of these 
fare classes offers an otherwise identical seat at a different price, some highly discounted 
and others at full fare. In addition, once the airline has sold a predetermined number of 
discounted seats, it can decide to stop selling those seats and revert to selling only full-fare 
seats. 
Similarly, hotels face the same set of constraints and opportunity for using yield man-
agement. The number of rooms available is fi xed, the potential to sell a hotel room (and 
therefore its value) perishes every morning, and customers will book a hotel room ahead 
of time. As such, hoteliers will often use yield management techniques as well, setting 
room-rate classes to offer otherwise identical rooms at different prices and restricting 
the availability of discounted rooms over time. Other consumer products can be priced 
using yield management, such as rental cars, passenger rail tickets, sporting and theatrical 
events, and even restaurant bookings.
Yield pricing has also found its place within industrial markets. Freight transport 
fi rms, including air freight, container ships, and even trucking, face the same constraints 
in capacity fl exibility and perishability. Like passenger air travel, customers of these 
industries are likely to reserve transport capacity ahead of time. Similarly, media fi rms 
selling broadcast advertising benefi t from yield management techniques due to the same 
set of constraints and opportunities. Given the drivers of yield management techniques, 
other industries, such as contract manufacturing, might also benefi t from this price 
structure. 
Moving beyond an operational perspective of the constraints faced by the fi rm, we 
can also fi nd some similarities in the structure of the markets served in these industries. 
Although some of the markets where yield pricing is practiced are consumer-oriented and 
others are industrial, all the markets where yield pricing has been deployed enjoy a large 
number of potential customers. Moreover, not only are different customers willing to pay 
a different price for an otherwise similar good, but their willingness to pay will change 
over time depending on the specifi c drivers of their demand and their own behavior as 
customers. Furthermore, many of the customers of these industries transact with fi rms on 
a “one-off” basis. While fi rms in these industries may nurture and value customer loyalty, 
they are also aware that the demand for their service is contingent on specifi c factors 
that will draw a number of customers into the market on a sporadic basis, rather than a
continual fl ow where predictability in pricing would be valued higher. Alternatively stated,

the market heterogeneity in willingness to pay extends beyond the customer-segment level 
and is expressed in the timing of the purchase and the occasion that drove the purchase. 
As such, customers in these industries accept a high degree of price variance, and the fi rms 
serving in these industries enjoy a wide degree of pricing latitude. 
In this chapter, we will explore some of the basic concepts and analytical foundation 
to yield management. While we will use the airline and hotel industries as examples, the 
exact same issues and techniques are used by both other consumer and industrial fi rms 
that practice yield management.2
Fare Classes and Booking Control
Yield management is a technique to maximize revenue by dynamically controlling the
number of units sold within any given fare class. For example, consider airline fare classes 
and booking processes. The airline will market a number of fare classes on a given fl ight. Just 
as the total number of seats available on a given fl ight is fundamentally limited, the airline 
will limit the number of seats available in any given fare class on that fl ight. The booking 
limit is the number of available seats within a given fare class on a specifi c fl ight.
When a customer attempts to make a reservation, the fi rm will review the booking limit on 
the available fare classes. If there is suffi cient availability within the fare class, the reservation 
is booked. If the reservation for a fare class would exceed the booking limit, that reservation 
is denied; and the fi rm may instead offer a different fare class or alternative reservation to 
capture that customer. For example, consider a family booking four seats on a fl ight. If the 
booking limit is currently three seats for the lower-priced fare class but there are ample seats 
at the higher-priced fare class, then the offer is made to book the seats at the higher-priced 
fare and denied at the lower-priced fare. This process is known as booking control.
FIXED ALLOTMENT
One of the fi rst approaches to controlling bookings was through fi xed allotment. In the 
fi xed allotment approach, available capacity is divided into discrete chunks (fare classes), 
and each fare class is allocated a fi xed number of seats. Customers can book seats in any 
fare class until the fi xed allotment of seats in that fare class has been fi lled. Once that fi xed 
allotment has been reached, seats on that fl ight will be offered only in other fare classes. 
So long as customers book the allotted seats in the lowest-priced fare class prior to fi ll-
ing up higher-priced fare classes, the fi xed allotment approach works to maximize revenue. 
However, if customers fi ll up the allotted seats in the higher-fare class prior to fi lling up 
those in a lower-fare class, then the fi xed allotment approach would direct the fi rm to 
force customers into lower-priced seats even if these customers might be willing to pay the 
higher fare. Clearly, such a result would not maximize the potential revenue.
For an example of the fi xed allotment approach, consider a 120-seat aircraft with three 
fare classes on a specifi ed fl ight. Let 24 seats be allocated to business class at $550 a seat, 60 
seats be allocated to full-fare coach at $300, and 36 seats be allocated to discounted coach 
at $200. Furthermore, assume that the airline provides increasing amenities with each fare 
class, such as allowing for seat choice and the free transport of two pieces of baggage for 
full-fare-coach and business-class customers, but not to discounted-coach customers. In 
this price structure, it is possible for the airline to sell all 60 full-fare coach seats prior to 
selling all the allocated 36 discounted coach seats. When the full-fare coach seats fi ll up 
prior to the discounted coach seats, the fi xed allotment approach to yield management 
would encourage the airline to deny any further full-fare coach customers as it holds seats 
open for discounted customers. Clearly, denying seats for higher-priced customers while

DYNAMIC NESTING
Dynamic nesting is the approach taken to controlling bookings that improves on the 
limitations of the fi xed allotment approach. As with the fi xed allotment method, dynamic 
nesting assigns each fare class a booking limit. Unlike a fi xed allotment method, the 
booking limits on all fare classes are reduced as seats are reserved in any individual fare 
class in dynamic nesting to prevent the possibility of rejecting high-fare bookings while 
reserving seats for low-fare bookings.
In this section, we will fi rst describe the mechanics of dynamic nesting, then provide 
an example in Exhibit 14-1. Readers may wish to look ahead to the exhibit while reading 
the description.
To describe dynamic nesting, let us defi ne bi as the booking limit for class i, where i goes 
from 1 to n, and n is the number of fare classes under management. The fi rst fare class,
i 5 1, will have the highest fare, and the last fare class, i 5 n, will have the lowest fare. In 
dynamic nesting, the booking limits decrease as one goes from the most expensive to the 
least expensive fare class. That is, for n fare classes, dynamic nesting requires
b1 $ b2 $ b3 $ ??? bn  
Eq. 14.1
The booking limit for the highest fare class will equal the total number of seats 
available on the aircraft. By setting b1 equal to the number of seats on the plane, the
airline can book all seats at full fare if customer demand warrants it. That is, if the airline 
receives reservations for nothing but the highest fare class, the airline will book the entire 
plane at that fare class. (The dynamic nesting approach that we describe can be refi ned to 
include issues regarding fi xed differences between different fare classes, such as seat sizes 
and confi gurations. Such refi nements would still incorporate the conceptual approach
described herein, and therefore they are ignored for the current discussion to keep it 
simple for educational purposes.)
In dynamic nesting, the booking limits on all fare classes are reduced as seats are
reserved in any individual fare class. That is, if a customer books a seat in the fi rst fare 
class, the fi rst-fare-class booking limit, as well as all lower-fare-class booking limits, is

reduced by 1. Likewise, if a customer books a seat in the third fare class, the booking limit 
on the fi rst, second, third and all other fare classes is reduced by 1 as well. 
So long as customers request fewer seats than the booking limit on that fare class, the 
reservation is accepted and the ticket is sold. If a customer requests more tickets than are 
available within a fare class, that request is denied and the customer is allowed to book 
only within the next higher available fare class. 
In dynamic nesting, booking limits are also described in terms of protection levels. The 
protection level for a fare class is the number of seats held available for that fare class and 
all higher fare classes. In a sense, protection levels are the mirror image of booking limits. 
If we defi ne yi as the protection level for class i, then the protection level for class i is equal 
to the difference between the total booking limit and the i 1 1 booking limit: 
yi 5 b1 2 bi11 
Eq. 14.2
Under this defi nition of the protection levels, the nesting condition of decreasing booking 
limits becomes one of increasing protection levels: 
y1 # y2 # y3 # ??? yn21  
Eq. 14.3
The protection level on any given fare class is held constant until all seats in the 
next-lower-priced fare class are reserved in dynamic nesting. Once all available seats in 
lower-priced fare classes are reserved, further reservations reduce the protection on that 
fare class. In this way, the higher-priced fare classes are the most protected and are kept 
available for last-minute customers. 
We can show how dynamic nesting of booking limits and protection levels works by 
returning to our example of a 120-seat aircraft with three fare classes. Again, the airline 
might expect 24 seats to be reserved in business class at $550, 60 seats to be reserved in 
full-fare coach at $300, and 36 seats to be reserved in discounted coach at $200. With 
this price structure, n equals 3. The fi rst fare class is business class, the second fare class is
full-fare coach, and the third fare class is discounted coach. 
To manage the expected reservation requests with dynamic nesting, the airline should 
set the booking limit for business class at b1 5 120, that for full-fare coach at b2 5 96, and 
fi nally for discounted coach at b3 5 36. With a booking limit of 36 for the discounted 
coach seats, the airline will allow only 36 seats to be booked at a discounted coach fare. 
It will also allow a full 96 (60 1 36) seats to be booked at full-fare coach if all full-fare 
coach reservations are made before any discounted-fare reservations. Likewise, it will 
allow 120 (24 1 60 1 36) seats to be booked at the business class fare if all business 
class customers made reservations before any full-fare or discounted-fare customers. In 
this manner, dynamic nesting overcomes the shortcomings of a fi xed allotment method. 
No customer who would otherwise pay a higher fare is forced into a lower fare class.
Following from the defi nition of the protection level for any given fare class, the airline will 
initially set the protection level for business class at y1 5 24 (b1 2 b2 5 120 2 96 5 24), that 
for full-fare coach at y2 5 84 (b1 2 b3 5 120 2 36 5 84), and that for discounted coach at 
y3 5 120 (b1 2 b4 5 120 2 [). As customers reserve seats in a given fare class, the airline will 
reduce the booking limits for that fare class and all lower fare classes until a fare class is ex-
hausted. Consequently, protection levels for specifi c fare classes will be reduced sequentially 
starting from the lowest protected class and moving up to the highest protected fare class.
In Exhibit 14-1, we show an example of how booking limits and protection levels 
would be updated dynamically as customers make a hypothetical series of reservations. 
Each line in the table represents a reservation request, the booking limits and protection 
levels at the time of the request, the decision to accept or reject the reservation request, and 
the resulting number of seats sold in each class. 
In dynamic nesting, a class can be closed as a result of accepting bookings for a higher 
class. We see this in the fi fth request for fi ve seats in Class 2. Once the request has been

Chapter 14 Yield Management
accepted, the booking limit for Class 3 fares has reached zero while those for Class 1 and 
2 are still above zero, implying that no further bookings would be accepted in Class 3 
even though the last reservation was for Class 2. Even though the airline will not have 
sold the full booking limit on the lowest-fare seats, the airline would refuse to sell further 
seats within that fare class to protect seats for higher-paying customers. When used in this
manner, the booking limit on a fare class closes once the aircraft has that many seats 
booked, regardless of the combination of fare classes booked.
Furthermore, dynamic nesting ensures that fare classes are closed in order, from the lowest-
priced fare class to the highest-priced fare class. We see this in the fact that the fi fth booking 
closes the discounted coach fare class, while the eighth booking closes the full-fare coach class. 
In this manner, higher fare classes are consistently more protected than lower fare classes. 
CANCELLATIONS, NO-SHOWS, AND OVERBOOKING
It is common for customers to make reservations and subsequently cancel them before
departure or fail to appear at the time of departure. To manage cancellations and
no-shows, two techniques are commonly used in yield management. First, to account 
for no-shows, booking limits can be initially adjusted upward above available capacity
according to the expected number of no-shows. If all customers show up for an over-
booked fl ight, the airline may make an offer to encourage customers to accept a later 
fl ight. Second, to manage cancellations, seats can be added back to the booking limits of 
the appropriate fare classes once a reservation is canceled. Other approaches are used and 
are profi t-effective, yet these two are the simplest.
Capacity Allocation and Revenue Optimization
Dynamic nesting ensures that fare classes are closed off from the bottom up and that
customers can always purchase from more expensive fare classes until capacity is
exhausted. A prerequisite for dynamic nesting is setting the booking limits and subsequent 
protection levels for the different fare classes. Capacity allocation refers to the method by 
which booking limits are defi ned for the relevant fare classes. 
We can explore the capacity allocation problem by analyzing a simple two-class
problem. Capacity allocations with multiple classes can be managed conceptually with 
the same approach as that presented in this section. More commonly, however, capacity 
allocation decisions with multiple fare classes are made using managerial decision
heuristics that develop as an approximation of the two-class solution presented here and 
which can be found in more advanced texts on revenue management.
CAPACITY ALLOCATION WITH CERTAIN DEMAND
If the demand is known ahead of time (that is, if demand is perfectly forecasted), then 
the capacity allocation challenge is trivial. Giving the highest priority to the most expensive 
fare class and the lowest priority to the least expensive, capacity would be allocated
according to forecasted demand.
For example, suppose a hotel operator was managing 30 rooms, each with equal
amenities. At this hotel, the standard room rate is $250 per night and the discount rate is 
$150. To improve revenue, the hotel may have a yield management policy to hold some 
full-fare rooms available for last-minute customers arriving on the night of the stay, while 
selling discounted rooms to customers who make early reservations.
If the hotel operator strongly suspects that on a particular night, it will have exactly
10 people showing up to request a room, that operator should hold 10 rooms available for 
full-fare customers arriving on that night. This would imply that the protection level for 
full-fare customers for the hotel would be set at 10 (y1 5 10), while allowing the remaining

rooms to be reserved at the discounted rate (y2 5 30). In comparison to selling all the rooms 
at the discounted price on a fi rst-come, fi rst-served basis, a yield management policy to
protect 10 rooms for full-fare customers would increase nightly revenue by $1,000. 
CAPACITY ALLOCATION WITH UNCERTAIN DEMAND
Yield management can be extended to include uncertainties in demand. Even when demand is 
uncertain, past experience can be used to forecast that demand will lie within some range. To 
optimize capacity allocation decisions in the face of uncertain demand, yield management tech-
niques can rely on the quantifi cation of the probability that demand will lie at different levels.
The normal distribution function, also known as the Gaussian or bell curve, is commonly 
used to describe demand in the face of uncertainty. To defi ne the normal distribution function 
of demand, forecasters only need to quantify two aspects, the expected average and the range in 
demand. See Appendix 14 for a mathematical description of the normal distribution function.
Probability Function
Returning to our 30-room hotel, the hotel operator may expect that on average, 10 rooms 
will be demanded at full fare on a given night, but it is uncertain as to whether full-price 
demand will be for 6 rooms or 14 rooms (10 plus or minus 4). In this case, the average 
demand is 10. The standard deviation is a measure of the uncertainty in the demand. 
Higher standard deviations express higher uncertainty, while lower standard deviations 
express lower uncertainty. Demand for hotels varies considerably from night to night. The 
hotel operator may believe that 68 percent of the time, the full-price demand is between 6 
and 14 rooms. That is, the operator is 68 percent confi dent that the true demand will be 
somewhere between 6 and 14 rooms, and accepts that 32 percent of the time, the demand 
is outside this range. In this case, the standard deviation in demand for rooms is 4. (In 
a normal distribution, 68 percent of the time, the expressed demand will lie within one 
standard deviation of the average expected demand.) The normal distribution in demand 
for the previously described case is shown in Exhibit 14-2. (We have approximated the 
distribution function in this graph using a discrete representation of the normal distribution 
function. See Appendix 14.)
Cumulative Probability Function
The normal distribution describes the probability that exactly 6, 10, 14, or any other number 
of customers would be willing to pay for a full-priced room on the evening in question. But 
the probability of selling 10 full-priced rooms isn’t the probability that exactly 10 people will 
want a full-priced room—it is the probability that 10 or more people will want a full-priced 
room. Yield management optimizes revenue by setting protection levels on higher-priced 
rooms according to the probability of selling these rooms, not simply the probability that 
demand is exactly equal to the protection levels. To fi nd the probability of selling 10 more 
rooms, we need to use the cumulative probability function, or more specifi cally, 1 minus the 
cumulative probability function when using a continuous function.
The cumulative probability function can be used to describe the probability that
demand is at or below a given level. Thus, 1 minus the continuous cumulative probability 
function describes the probability that demand is at or above a given level.
We can show how the cumulative probability function helps defi ne allocation rules by re-
turning to our example hotel with average demand of 10 and standard deviation in demand 
of 4 for full-priced rooms. See Exhibit 14-3, which has been calculated using the discrete ap-
proximation of the normal distribution function. (See Appendix 14 for details on the discrete 
approximation of the normal distribution function.) The demand schedule shows that if 1 
room is protected for full-price customers, there is a 99 percent probability for that room to be 
purchased at full price. Likewise, if 8 rooms are protected, there is a 73 percent probability that 
all 8 rooms would be demanded at full price, if 10 rooms are protected, there is a 55 percent

Chapter 14 Yield Management
probability that all 10 rooms would be demanded at full price, and if 12 rooms are protected, 
there is a 35 percent probability that all 12 rooms would be demanded at full price.
The fact that the demand schedule predicts that only 55 percent of the time, the hotel would 
sell 10 protected rooms is the result of 10 being the median number of rooms expected to sell at 
full price. The defi nition of the median average is that it lies in the middle. In this case, 10 percent 
of the time exactly 10 rooms would be demanded, 45 percent of the time fewer than 10 rooms 
would be demanded and 45 percent of the time more than 10 rooms would be demanded.
Revenue Optimization
Cumulative distribution functions enable yield managers to forecast demand. Using the 
demand expectations associated with different protection levels along with the revenue 
impact, capacity can be allocated in a manner that is predicted to optimize revenue.
At the time of setting protection levels, it is not known whether the demand will be at, 
above, or below that predicted. However, the probability of selling that room at full price 
can be predicted from the normal distribution function. Hence, we can form an expecta-
tion value of the revenue earned from full-priced rooms at a given protection level.
One method to optimize revenue is to examine protection-level decisions in terms of 
their marginal impact on expected revenue. Protecting a room for a full-price customer 
comes at the cost of not allowing the sale of that room to a discount-price customer. If the 
discounted room can be predicted to sell with certainty, the room should be protected for 
full-price customers only if the expected revenue earned from the next full-price customer 
is in excess of the discounted fare.
Let us return to the example hotel with an expected full-price demand of 10 rooms and 
standard deviation in demand of 4. If 10 rooms were protected for full-price customers,

Chapter 14 Yield Management
the expected marginal revenue earned from the tenth full-price customer is only $138, or 
55 percent of $250 where 55 percent is the probability that demand will be or exceed 10 
full-priced units and $250 is the revenue earned per full-priced unit. (See Exhibit 14-3.) 
If the hotel knows with certainty that it could sell all $150 discount-priced rooms if they 
were made available, it should not protect all 10 rooms for full-price customers because 
the expected revenue from the tenth full-price customer is less than the known revenue 
from the next discount-price customer. Hence, the hotel may wish to set the protection 
level lower to optimize revenue.
In contrast, setting the protection level to 9 rooms or higher for full-price cus-
tomers may be anticipated to improve revenue and therefore profi ts. The expected 
marginal revenue earned from the ninth full-price customer is $162, or 65 percent of 
$250 where 65 percent is the probability that demand will be or exceed 9 full-priced 
units and $250 is the revenue earned per full-priced unit. (See Exhibit 14-3.) Because 
the expected marginal revenue earned from protecting the ninth room for full-price 
customers is equal to or greater than the revenue that could be earned by selling it 
at a discount, the hotel should set the protection level here or higher. Other factors, 
such as desiring to please full-price customers over discount-price customers, drive 
otherwise equally profi table decisions to favor full-price customers over discount-price 
customers.
Exhibit 14-4 shows a schedule of anticipated demand and expected revenue for both 
full-priced and discount-priced rooms given uncertainty in full-price demand with the 
assumption that discount-price demand exceeds capacity. The fi rst column describes 
the potential protection level for full-priced rooms. The second describes the booking 
limit for discount-priced rooms. Given that the hotel expects that 10 full-priced rooms 
can be sold on that night, with a standard deviation of 4, the third column gives the 
probability that demand for full-priced rooms will be equal to or greater than the 
protection level. In the fourth and fi fth columns are the expected marginal and total
revenue earned from protecting the last full-priced room. The remaining columns
calculate the total revenue expected to be earned from the discount-price classes as well 
as the total overall expected revenue. 
From Exhibit 14-4, it is found that the optimal protection level under these assumptions 
is 9. By protecting 9 rooms for full-price customers, the hotel will knowingly be protecting 
fewer full-price rooms than is demanded on average. In fact, it expects the full-price room 
demand to be 10 or higher 55 percent of the time. The hotel will also be protecting the 
ninth full-priced room that it would otherwise expect to sell at a discounted rate but will 
sell at full price only 65 percent of the time. However, with a full-price booking limit of 
9, the probability adjusted expected revenue from the ninth full-price customer is greater 
than that of the twenty-fi rst discount customer.
At all lower full-price booking limits, the probability adjusted expected revenue from the 
last full-price customer exceeds that of the last discount customer. At any higher full-price 
booking limit, the probability adjusted expected revenue from the last full-price customer 
is below that of the last discount customer. Hence, the hotel can expect on average to 
maximize its profi ts by protecting 9 rooms for full-price customers, rather than simply the 
average of 10 rooms or any other number of rooms as well.
The optimal allocation of protection levels at 9 rooms can also be found by looking at 
the column for total expected revenue. At 9 rooms protected, total revenue is maximized. 
The total expected revenue for different protection levels described in Exhibit 14-4 is  plotted 
as in Exhibit 14-5. From either the schedule in Exhibit 14-4 or the plot in Exhibit 14-5, we 
can see that the overall revenue is maximized with a protection level of 9. We can also see in 
Exhibit 14-5 that if the protection level increases further, the expected revenue contribution 
from full-price customers begins to level off, making higher protection levels come at a direct 
cost of lost discount revenue.

Chapter 14 Yield Management
Decision Tree Approach
Yield management optimizes revenue by allocating capacity between different fare classes 
in a manner that maximizes the expected overall revenue earned on the resource. As seen 
in the hotel example, yield management includes a careful tradeoff between the expected 
revenue earned from lower-price customers versus that from higher-price customers. On 
one hand, if the fi rm turns away discount bookings in the hopes of earning a full-price 
customer that never materializes, the empty seat or room goes unsold. This is called spoilage 
because inventory becomes spoiled the moment the plane takes off or the evening comes 
to a close. On the other hand, if the fi rm accepts discounted sales that force it to turn 
away full-price customers, it runs the risk of selling seats at a less favorable price. This is 
called dilution because the potential revenue is diluted with excess low-price sales. The
goal in capacity allocation decisions within yield management is to balance the lost
revenue of spoilage with that of dilution to maximize expected revenue.
We can represent this tradeoff simply with a decision tree. See Exhibit 14-6. Let C be the 
capacity of the resource and B be the booking limit on the lower price class. The decision to 
be made is whether the fi rm should increase the lower-price booking limit by 1. Increasing 
the lower-price booking limit by 1 increases the risk of dilution. Holding the lower-price 
booking limit constant increases the risk of spoilage.
If the booking limit on the lower price class is increased by 1 but the discount price 
demand is less than the current booking limit, then the increase in the booking limit will 
have no impact on revenue. In dynamic nesting, capacity unsold in a lower price class 
remains available for sale to a higher fare class, hence increasing the discount-price-class 
booking limit by 1 when no discount customer will demand that capacity has no effect 
on revenue. The probability that the discount-price demand is less than the current booking 
limit is Gd(B), where Gd(B) is the cumulative probability function that discount-price 
demand is equal to or less than the current booking limit, B. (Readers may fi nd it useful 
to consider the continuous form of the normal distribution function for this section.)
If the booking limit on the lower price class is increased by 1 and the discount-price 
demand is greater than the current booking limit, then the increase in the booking limit 
may affect revenue. The probability that discount-price demand is greater than the current 
booking limit is 1 2 Gd(B). To determine if the potential impact is positive or negative, we 
have to examine the probability that a full-price customer will arrive.

If the discount-price demand is greater than the current discount-price booking limit, an 
increase in this booking limit means that the fi rm is taking the chance of gaining revenue 
equal to the price of the discount price class (Pd) in the hope that the full-price demand is 
below the current protection level. The probability that the full-price demand is below its 
current protection level is Gf (C 2 B), where Gf (C 2 B) is the cumulative probability function 
that full-price demand is equal to or less than the current protection limit, C 2 B. The prob-
ability that the full-price demand is at or above its current protection level is 1 2 Gf (C 2 B). 
Increasing the booking limit on the discount fare runs the risk of forfeiting potential full-fare 
revenue of Pf to gain discount revenue of Pd , at a cost of Pd 2 Pf  . 
Altogether, the expected impact on revenue from increasing the booking limit by 1 is 
equal to the probability-weighted sum of the possible outcomes. We can express this as
E[B → B 1 1] 5 Gd (B) ? 0 1 [1 2 Gd (B)] ? [(1 2 Gf (C 2  B)) ? (Pd 2 Pf ) 
 
 
  1 Gf (C 2 B) ? Pd] 
 
5 [1 2 Gd (B)] ? [Pd 2 Pf ? (1 2 Gf (C 2  B))] 
Eq. 14.4
If the expected impact on revenue from increasing the booking limit by 1 is equal to or 
greater than zero (E[B → B 1 1]), then increasing the booking is expected to improve 
revenue and decrease spoilage. If not, then it would harm revenue by increasing dilution.
Because the optimal discount fare booking limit is that in which further increases in the 
booking limit either have no effect or a negative effect on the expected revenue, we can 
fi nd the discount price optimal booking limit by setting Equation 14.4 equal to zero. After 
some rearrangement, we fi nd that
1  Gf (C  Bˆ)   Pd 
___ 
Pf
  
Eq. 14.5
The resulting Equation 14.5 is Littlewood’s rule, where ˆB is the optimal booking limit. 
The left side of Equation 14.5 is the probability that full-price demand will exceed the 
protection level. The right side is the ratio of the price classes. Littlewood’s rule is a simple 
means to fi nding the optimal booking limit for any two-class revenue optimization problem 
under a yield management price structure.

Chapter 14 Yield Management
While it may appear counterintuitive that the optimal protection level does not depend 
on the forecasted discount-price demand, it is a result of the nesting of booking limits. With 
nested booking limits, all the seats not sold to discounted customers are available for full-
price customers. Hence, the optimal booking limit does not depend on the discount fare 
demand, only on the probability of demand for higher-price customers and the dispersion 
in prices between low and high price classes.
Further Enhancements to Yield Management
The yield management techniques described in this chapter have been extended to improve 
revenue further in a number of ways, most notably in improving capacity allocation rules 
to take into account multiple price classes and potential dependent demand effects. While 
the various yield management techniques share many conceptual commonalities, they dif-
fer in specifi cs. 
Optimal capacity allocations with more than two price classes quickly become more 
computationally complicated as price classes are added. To address these challenges, 
fi rms often turn to Expected Marginal Seat Revenue (EMSR) heuristics to accelerate 
calculations for the multiple price class problems. (Discussions on EMSR can be found in 
advanced texts that specifi cally explore yield management.)
Far more challenging have been the effects of dependent demand, especially in light of 
network effects. Customers often do not seek to purchase a single price class on a specifi c 
fl ight nor a single night at a hotel, but rather a series of connected purchases that might 
include multiple legs between airports or multiple nights at a hotel. The simple yield man-
agement technique presented herein fails to optimize revenue in the face of dependent 
demand challenges. Network management techniques have been introduced to improve 
the revenue earned on multiple resources with dependent demand.
Summary
• Yield management is a dynamic pricing technique used to optimize revenue earned 
from a fi xed-capacity resource.
• From an internal perspective, the key requirements for using yield management 
include (1) limited and perishable capacity, (2) customers reserving a portion of the 
capacity ahead of time, (3) the fi rm selling a portion of the capacity at a variety of 
prices, also known as fare classes, and (4) the fi rm changing the availability of fare 
classes over time.
• Yield management is used in a variety of industries, most notably with airlines and 
hotels but also with freight transport and broadcast advertising.
• From a market perspective, yield management is favored by large markets, 
with multiple customers exhibiting different willingness to pay that is partially 
correlated with the time of purchase.
• Yield management uses booking control to manage the availability of price classes. 
The dominant approach to booking control in yield management is dynamic 
nesting, a technique that ensures that the highest price class has the highest 
availability regardless of the order in which customers request price classes.
• In dynamic nesting, the booking limit of all equal and lower price classes is reduced 
as seats in a given price class are reserved. Once a price class has reached its 
booking limit, no further reservations are allowed within that class.
• Yield management uses capacity allocation rules to determine booking limits 
of price classes. The goal in capacity allocation decisions is to maximize the 
probability-weighted expected revenue from a resource.

• Because future demand is uncertain, capacity allocation decisions must be made using 
probabilities. One method is to assume a normal distribution in demand to assign the 
probability that demand will exhaust capacity at a given capacity allocation.
• Capacity allocation decisions force tradeoffs between the costs of spoilage, where 
inventory goes unsold, and the cost of dilution, where inventory that could have 
been sold at a higher price is sold at a lower price.

The Normal Distribution Function
The normal distribution function has been explored for over three centuries and is 
commonly used to describe not only consumer behavior, such as demand, but a range of 
other phenomena in science, economics, and other disciplines. The probability distribution 
function for the normal distribution is given by

where the average demand is denoted by the Greek letter m (pronounced “mu”); the
standard deviation is denoted by the Greek letter s (pronounced “sigma”); and g(x) is the 
probability of fi nding demand x given a normal distribution in demand.

The cumulative distribution function at some point is the sum of the probabilities that 
the demand is at that point or at any point up to that point. For continuous functions, 
sums are calculated using integrals. Thus, the cumulative distribution that demand will be 
at or below some point is simply
G(x, m, s ) 5  ∫ 
2∞ 
x
  g(x', m, s )dx'  
Eq. 14.7
Cumulative distribution functions have the property of ranging from 0 at G(2`) to 1 
at G(1`). That is, we know that the actual demand for a product has a value somewhere 
in the range between 2` and 1`, be it at 0, 6, 10, or 14. Hence, the total probability that 
demand will express itself is 1.
To fi nd the probability that demand is equal to or greater than some level—that is, that 
demand is at or exceeds some protection level—simply subtract the cumulative distribution 
function from 1. This property follows from the defi nition of the cumulative distribution 
function. If we know that G(x) is the probability that demand is less than or equal to x 
units, then 1 2 G(x) is the probability that demand will be x or higher.
Probability Demand Exceeds x 5 1 2 G(x) 
Eq. 14.8
Normal distribution functions and their cumulative distribution functions are standard 
functions found in most computational software.3
Because rooms cannot be sold in fractional or negative amounts, but only as positive 
whole units, we use the discrete normal distribution rather than the continuous normal 
distribution function. The discrete normal distribution can be approximated from the 
continuous normal distribution through the following equations. Let G(i, m, s) be the cu-
mulative probability that the discrete demand is for i or fewer units as approximated from 
the continuous normal distribution function, then the discrete probability that the demand 
is for i units can be expressed as 
gD(0, m, s) 5 G(0.5, m, s)  
for i 5 0 
 
gD(i, m, s) 5 G(i 1 0.5, m, s) 2 G(i 2 0.5, m, s)  
for i 5 1, 2, 3, . . . n 
Eq. 14.9
Similarly, the cumulative probability function that demand is greater than i or equal to i, 
which is used to calculate if a room is sold given a booking limit, is approximated as
Probability Demand Meets or Exceeds i 5 1 2 G(i 2 0.5, m, s)  
Eq. 14.10
Because the discrete version of the normal distribution function requires approximations, 
certain small errors will arise. The signifi cance of these errors will depend on the nature of 
the challenge being addressed. In this chapter, we have used the discrete normal distribution 
function as approximated through Equations 14.9 and 14.10.

W
hile the focus of strategic pricing is to align the fi rm’s prices with its market’s will-
ingness to pay, we cannot ignore that the willingness to pay of customers is affected 
by the actions of competitors. Pricing is not done in a vacuum. Competitors, as well 
as their pricing actions, clearly limit the latitude that a fi rm has in managing prices strategically.
The role of competition has been implied throughout this text. In using exchange value 
models and their ability to reveal a customer’s willingness to pay, a key component is 
developing an understanding of the price and value of competing alternatives. Likewise, 
in developing prices based on consumer perceptions, the perceived value that customers 
give to a product is infl uenced by the perceived price points of the alternatives.

Chapter 15 
Competition and Pricing
In much of strategic pricing, the goal is to drive the competitive frontier to another 
dimension. As explored in the discussion of the profi t sensitivity to price changes in 
Chapter 2, it is only possible to lower prices and drive suffi cient volume to improve 
profi ts in a limited number of situations. Tactically, price promotions can be effective in 
capturing marginal customers. Strategically, price competition usually leaves all fi rms 
impoverished. Rather than using price as a competitive weapon, most fi rms are better 
off using other levers of strategic marketing, such as market segmentation, product 
defi nition, promotional media selection, brand positioning, and distribution.
If we consider price structures, we fi nd that the fi rst fi rm to adopt a new price 
structure often reaps enormous rewards, while others must struggle to catch up. For 
instance, consider the effect that bundling offi ce software in 1992 had on the fortunes 
of Microsoft compared to Lotus 123, WordPerfect, and Eudora. Unfortunately, a fi rm 
can only infrequently redefi ne the price structure in a way that strikes a strategic blow 
to its competitors.
These insights into strategic pricing are in line with a principle behind a concept regard-
ing competitive advantage. All competitive advantage derives from being different from 
competitors, not copying them. Strategic resources are strategic precisely because they are 
rare and diffi cult to imitate. They deliver a competitive advantage because they enable a 
fi rm to be more profi table. When we search for sources of competitive advantage, we can 
fi nd them in strategic resources that enable the fi rm to add value without adding as much 
cost, reduce cost without reducing as much value, or accelerating reaction time to seize 
new opportunities. None of these issues imply that price, in and of itself, is a strategic 
resource.
Moreover, simply selling a “me-too” product at a lower price is not the same as
developing a strategic resource, and it is therefore unlikely to enable the fi rm to achieve 
greater profi ts than its competitors. Rather, selling products that deliver distinct value to 
distinct market segments, pricing the product according to the value that those segments 
are willing to pay, and communicating the value of that product to those segments, deliver 
superior returns.
Hence, we come to the conclusion that pricing below competitors does not constitute 
a competitive advantage. Even pricing to capture market share is a dubious argument 
because there is little value in having the largest share of the market without making 
profi ts. Yet we are also confronted with the obvious fact that competition affects pricing. 
So, how does competition infl uence pricing strategy? Should a fi rm ever price below 
its competition? There are cases where a fi rm should seek to undercut its competitors, 
just as there are cases where a fi rm should ignore a competitor that has lowered prices. 
In addition, there are situations where a fi rm must respond to a competitor’s efforts to 
undercut it. In this chapter, we turn to the challenge of managing prices strategically in 
the face of competition.
The Origin of Price Wars
The purpose of all war is ultimately peace.
 
—Saint Augustine of Hippo
Rarely do companies enter a price war on purpose. Despite popular hearsay that a fi rm 
enters into price wars with the motive to drive competitors out of a market and then 
increase its price and gain higher profi ts, there has been scant economic evidence of suc-
cess with this strategy. This is for good reason: It is hard to make this strategy work. The 
cost of a price war is inherently expensive, with the immediate loss of profi ts or, worse, 
mounting losses over time. Furthermore, the benefi ts of winning a price war are highly 
uncertain.

Rarely does a price war lead to an industry shakeout. Although a price war may weaken 
a competitor, it is hard to kill an established organization and permanently remove
industry capacity. Decisive victories are rare.
Even if a competitor exits the market and the fi rm is able to raise its prices and enjoy 
monopoly profi ts, the nature of competitive markets implies that the higher profi ts earned 
by a fi rm in a market will only invite other competitors to enter or reenter that market. 
Hence, the monopoly position hard-won through a price war is highly unlikely to yield 
suffi cient profi ts to cover the costs incurred in fi ghting the war.
Hence, the realistic purpose of a price war cannot be to kill the competition. Moreover, 
when executives fi nd themselves in a price war, they should strive to achieve a future state 
of peace in which their fi rm can fl ourish.
Despite the fact that price wars are generally illogical, we know that they will 
break out at times. Their cause can be somewhat anticipated by considering the profi t 
goals of most companies and their need to seize the opportunity to achieve these 
goals. Although companies will rarely initiate a purposeful price war, they will seek 
to seize opportunities in the market. Unfortunately, this orientation toward taking 
action to seize market share, coupled with an inability to either manage or anticipate
actions with competitors, can lead to an unnecessary price war and reduction of overall
industry profi ts.
We have already seen evidence that such results are common. In reviewing brand-
versus industry-level elasticity of demand for a number of consumer products, we found 
that the brand-level elasticity of demand was typically in the elastic range while the 
industry-level elasticity of demand was typically in the inelastic range. From a profi t 
maximization viewpoint, it never makes sense to price in the inelastic range. Hence, most 
of the industries considered would benefi t from an overall price increase. However, that 
would imply that individual competitors within that industry, which individually face 
an elastic demand, would need to raise their prices collectively. If any one fi rm raises its 
prices without its competitors raising their prices simultaneously, customers will switch 
brands, and that one fi rm will lose market share and profi ts. Because it is unlikely that 
all competitors would be able to raise prices in a coordinated manner without illegal
collusion, it is rare to see industry-level prices driven signifi cantly high so as to maximize 
profi ts at the industry level.
PRISONER’S DILEMMA
We can see how the logic of competition and opportunity seeking can lead to an 
overall reduction of industrywide profi ts by considering the prisoner’s dilemma. 
The prisoner’s dilemma is so named because it describes the situation faced by two
suspected criminals put into separate rooms for questioning. Law enforcement
investigators then make offers to both suspects to confess and implicate the other in 
exchange for a lighter sentence. If no suspect confesses, the investigators don’t have 
a case, and both suspects are set free. However, investigators usually choose not to 
reveal this fact. Because neither suspect can communicate his intention not to confess 
to the other, and because both of them are facing the offer of confessing in exchange 
for a lighter sentence, one of them is likely to yield to the pressure. Once that happens, 
both prisoners get a criminal sentence, although the one who confesses gets a lighter 
punishment than the holdout.
Competing fi rms considering a price reduction often face a payoff matrix that is similar 
to that faced by suspected criminals in the prisoner’s dilemma. Consider two hypothetical 
competitors in the same industry, Alpha and Beta, and the payoff matrix that they face 
by taking a price action. See Exhibit 15-1. Four potential confi gurations can take place in 
this industry.

Chapter 15 
Competition and Pricing
First, consider the case where neither party takes a price action, leaving the industry 
in a relatively stable condition. In our hypothetical payoff matrix, this is captured in the 
lower-right corner, where both Alpha and Beta enjoy $600 million in revenue. Note that 
in this position, the overall industry-level revenue is $1.2 billion.
In the next two scenarios, either competing fi rm can reduce its prices by itself, with the 
expectation of taking market share. Such a price action will leave that fi rm relatively better 
off, but at the expense of its competitor and with a small reduction overall in industrywide 
profi tability. This is captured in the lower-left and upper-right corners of our hypothetical
payoff matrix. In the example payoff matrix, such an action may raise the revenue of 
the competitor who uses price to gain market share to $800 million, while damaging the
revenue of its competitor to $300 million. In this example, the overall industry-level
revenue has been reduced to $1.1 billion.
Of course, if either fi rm alone took a price reduction to increase market share and 
revenue, it would only be in the competitor’s best interest to react with a similar pricing 
action to recoup lost share. The result would be that both fi rms end up lowering price, 
represented in the upper-left corner of our payoff matrix. Such a position would raise the 
revenue of the damaged fi rm, but it would also lead to a continued erosion of industry-
level profi tability. In the example, both parties end up with $500 million in revenue, for 
overall industry-level revenue of $1 billion.
While the previous example was hypothetical, real competitors do face similar 
challenges in managing their prices. In our example, we assumed symmetrical effects 
between equally strong competitors. The approach to analyzing the dilemma facing 
competitors regarding price actions can be expanded to consider unequal competitors, 
multiple competitors, and differing payoff matrices. The point of this example isn’t to 
analyze the specifi c situation of Alpha and Beta but to draw attention to the potential 
for opportunistic behavior from individual fi rms to lead to overall damage to all com-
petitors within an industry.
The prisoner’s dilemma indicates that all competitors in an industry are generally better
off if none compete on price. If no competitor initiates a pricing action and maintains the 
current industry-level prices, all competitors are in a better position overall. However,

incentives are such that most individual competitors have a short-term incentive to lower 
price to gain market share and increase revenues unless they consider the long-term
reactions of their competitors. Once a fi rm considers the reaction of a competitor to a 
price action, it will discover that the damage such an action would infl ict on the other 
competitors would likely encourage a similarly damaging reaction, thus leaving all fi rms 
weaker and removing revenue from the industry.
The goal in industry price management is to encourage competitors not to take mutually 
destructive pricing actions. If competitors could talk directly, mutually destructive pricing 
actions could be avoided. However, price collusion is highly illegal in all developed 
markets. However, the goal remains to encourage healthy pricing behavior throughout 
the industry.
STRUCTURAL DRIVERS
If all fi rms face short-term incentives to lower prices but long-term incentives not to lower 
prices, then any rational executive in any industry should understand that price reductions 
that encourage destructive retaliation should be avoided, and all price wars would cease. 
However, we know that somehow, price wars break out anyway.
Long-haul airlines have long been plagued with price wars, while branded food manu-
facturers appear to sustain a stable pricing environment. In looking at examples such as 
this and other industries as well, researchers have found fi ve structural drivers to price 
competition. Although any single structural factor does not cause price competition in and 
of itself, companies in industries with that are weak in these structural factors are more 
likely to face pressure to compete on price.
Number of Competitors
Industries with fewer competitors tend to be able to monitor one another’s pricing prac-
tices and respond appropriately. Therefore, a price action by any one competitor is likely 
to be observed and followed by a swift response from the other competitors, resulting in an 
overall destruction of industry-level profi ts, as previously discussed. Executives operating 
in industries with fewer competitors are also more likely to learn the costs of unnecessary 
price wars and the resulting negative-sum gains in initiating one. 
In contrast, perfectly competitive markets imply numerous competitors. With many com-
petitors, it becomes prohibitively costly to monitor the pricing actions of all competitors.
Any single competitor may therefore be able to use price to gain market share in the short 
run without fearing immediate retaliation from all other industry competitors. Moreover, 
if competitors follow suit with a similar price action, it will be diffi cult for the initiating 
fi rm to discern whether competitors are reacting to its price action or some other force. 
Hence, it is diffi cult for companies operating in industries with many competitors to learn 
of the costs and overall industry-level results of their own pricing actions.
As such, companies in highly concentrated industries are more likely to refrain from 
excessive price pressures, while those operating in industries that lack concentration often 
unwittingly enter into them.
Competitors’ Managerial Maturity
To understand the implications of using price to grab market share requires some level 
of maturity among the executives. Mature competitors are better positioned to both
anticipate competitors’ response to prices and be aware of competitors’ pricing practices. 
New entrants or immature competitors may lack the ability to detect competitors’ pricing 
actions or make grievous errors in anticipating the response to a price action. This kind 
of maturity may not just be a refl ection of the executives at one particular fi rm, but the
ability of the least refl ective executive within that industry to avoid setting off an

unnecessary price war. In highly competitive industries, executives are known to state:
“I can price only as well as the stupidest competitor.”
High Fixed Costs and Low Marginal Cost
Industries facing high fi xed costs but low marginal costs often face extreme pressure to 
lower prices to capture marginal revenue. Because marginal costs are low (and in some 
cases zero), most marginal revenue can be added directly to the overall corporate bottom 
line. Software fi rms, which face extreme pressures to gain revenue that translates into 
profi t, are operating in an environment that encourages an inordinate amount of price 
discounting. In software markets, discounting up to 90 percent from the list price is not 
unheard of, and many enterprise-class software fi rms consider discounts around 60 percent 
from the list price to be normal.
Industry Maturity and Economic Savings
The need for maturity extends beyond the executives and into the issue of the industry 
growth rate. With young, high-growth industries, executives face numerous incentives to 
grab market space in the hope of leveraging their operational demands into lower cost 
structures as the industry matures. These incentives may come from the expectation of 
future economies of scale, scope, or learning. If a fi rm can expect to gain future economies 
of scale, scope, or learning, it may have an incentive to use low prices to capture market 
share, penetrate new capabilities, or accelerate the learning curve in the expectation of 
long-term cost savings.
Economies of scale refers to the cost savings that a fi rm can gain that depend on the 
size of the fi rm as measured by its long-run, sustainable rate of output. As production 
volume increases, fi xed incremental costs that arise from product development or capacity 
increases can be spread over a larger number of units, reducing the long-run average cost. 
Economies of scale fi rst gained serious management attention after Henry Ford invented 
the modern assembly line for the automotive industry in 1913. Economies of scale can 
derive from multiple sources. For instance, as production volumes increase, workers can 
specialize, gaining profi ciency and reducing time lost on task switching, leading to reduced 
production costs. Likewise, more effi cient production technologies can be employed as the 
volume of production increases.
Economies of learning refers to reductions in cost that come from experience, as
measured by accumulated output. Economies of learning result from learning by doing. 
They can arise from increases in labor effi ciency, standardization, better utilization of 
equipment, more effi cient use of resources, or product design improvements that enable 
fast manufacturing. Economies of learning gained serious management attention from the 
production of aircraft for World War II. The relationship was probably fi rst quantifi ed in 
1936 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the United States, where it was determined 
that every time cumulative aircraft production doubled, the required labor time decreased 
by 10 to 15 percent.1
Economies of scope refers to the production cost reductions as the breadth of a 
fi rm’s activities increases. Like economies of scale, economies of scope depend on 
spreading shared costs over a larger number of units. Unlike economies of scale,
economies of scope do not necessarily rely on savings from specialization. For an 
example of economies of scope, a gas station can use the same fi xed assets to sell 
both fuel and food. Likewise, the same university classroom can be used to teach
mathematics, business, and literature. In economies of scope, a single resource is 
used for multiple activities. By spreading the costs of maintaining that resource over
multiple activities, the overall cost structure of the fi rm is reduced. Economies of scope 
became popular to discuss as a source of profi tability as the modern conglomerate

began to dominate industrial affairs during the middle of the twentieth century, and 
the term was coined in 1975.2
Industry Maturity and Network Externalities
Just as companies may be willing to price low in new industries in the hopes of gaining 
future cost savings from economies in scale, scope, or learning, they may also feel pressure 
to price low in the hopes of gaining an inordinate portion of the future revenue due to 
network externalities.
Products are said to benefi t from network externalities when the value of the product 
increases with the number of people who use it. Network externalities can drive price wars 
in industries facing two-sided markets or highly profi table complementary goods markets. 
For instance, the format war between Toshiba’s HD-DVD and Sony’s Blu-ray was largely 
driven by the network externalities that could be gained by either Toshiba or Sony in the 
sales of patented technology for creating and using media. Nintendo’s Wii, Microsoft’s 
Xbox, and Sony’s PS3 all face network externalities in the creation of game titles and 
the number of users with consoles. Similarly, Apple’s iPhone and Research in Motion’s 
BlackBerry face strong network externalities in the distribution of mobile handsets and 
applications for these handsets. Even user share can drive network externalities, as it does 
for social networking websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Skype.
Products that benefi t from network effects are marketed by a fi rm under high motivation
to increase the number of customers on its network. This may encourage the price of 
the products to be greatly reduced from what they would be priced at in absence of the 
network effects, to drive adaption. Once adaption is driven, the winner of the network 
may hope to gain an inordinate amount of the revenues from that industry because their 
network is more valuable than others. 
Reacting to Price Reductions
It is often better to be a small competitor in a profi table industry 
than a large competitor in an unprofi table industry.
In calculating the response to a competitor’s price reduction, executives must calibrate 
their actions carefully. The reaction must be limited so as not to create the conditions 
for a price war to break out, but the reaction must be strong enough to counter a
competitor’s price action and improve the fi rm’s profi ts. If possible, the reaction should 
also communicate the message to a fi rm’s competitors that price wars will be mutually 
destructive.
Three issues can be considered when calibrating a response to a competitor’s price 
action. First, what are the direct costs and direct benefi ts of responding in tandem to a 
competitor’s price move? Second, what are the likely secondary consequences from taking 
a price response? Third, does that competitor have a strategic cost advantage that enables 
it to profi t at a lower industry price point?
DIRECT COSTS AND BENEFITS
When considering a response to a competitor’s price reduction, executives should evaluate 
the costs and benefi ts of their response. To reduce the chance of the response tipping off 
a price war, executives can focus any price response on the direct revenue at risk and the 
direct profi ts threatened rather than the general malaise generated from a competitor’s 
price reduction.
A competitor’s price reduction will generally threaten some of the fi rm’s revenue, but 
rarely all of it. In fact, sometimes it will threaten only a very small portion of the fi rm’s

Chapter 15 
Competition and Pricing
revenue. By identifying the exact nature of the revenue at risk of loss, the fi rm can target 
any matching price reduction to recapture that specifi c marginal revenue.
One method to clarify the risk is to examine a series of questions similar to the
following: Which market segment is at risk? Which customers are at risk of defecting to 
the competitor? How much of the revenue from those customers is placed at risk by the 
competitor’s price reduction? Which specifi c products’ sales are at risk? What business 
area is at risk? What is the probability that the specifi c revenue at risk will be lost? Are 
there other factors that may imply that the risks of losing revenue are still low after a 
competitor’s price reduction?
Likewise, the benefi ts of responding can be examined through a series of questions 
similar to the following: What is the probability of retaining those sales after matching 
a competitor’s price move? What profi ts would be gained by responding? What is the 
strategic importance of the specifi c revenue at risk? Does a foothold within the market 
threaten other revenue streams? Will blocking a competitor on the revenue at risk prevent 
that competitor from leveraging an entry point into other domains within the customer 
base?
SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES
When a fi rm responds to a price reduction by a competitor, two serious secondary 
consequences can arise. First, a price reduction in one situation may affect sales out-
side of the specifi c opportunity at risk. Second, the fi rm’s response to a price reduction 
by a competitor by matching that price reduction may lead to further rounds of price 
reductions.
Price concessions in one opportunity may enable other customers to demand a similar 
price concession in other situations. In industrial markets, it is possible for customers to 
learn of price concessions granted to specifi c clients. Other customers may then use this
information to demand similar price concessions during their next purchasing opportunity.
As such, a price response to win a specifi c tactical sale can quickly become a strategic price 
reduction across the board. Likewise, in consumer markets, price concessions to some cus-
tomers may be considered “unfair” if they are not provided to all customers. In the worst 
situation, highly profi table loyal customers discover price concessions granted to mar-
ginal customers but denied to themselves, and then go on to betray the brand. Firms can 
take steps to reduce these possibilities, but the threat should be assessed and mitigation
strategies should be executed. The nature of this line of inquiry is to quantify the profi ts 
threatened if the price reduction spreads to other sales, and therefore determine if the price 
response will cost less than the expected sales loss.
The competitive nature of business and the desire to win every opportunity yields a 
managerial inclination to match or beat any competitor’s price reduction. Left unchecked, 
this inclination can yield to developing an industry pricing atmosphere that is cutthroat, 
destroying the profi ts of all players within the industry and leaving all industry competitors
weaker. Price responses to a competitor’s price reduction may be followed by a further 
price cut by that competitor. The threat of a second round of price competition may 
lead to further profi t erosion and loss of pricing credibility. Before responding, companies 
should calculate the potential of wandering aimlessly into a damaging price war that can 
spread throughout the industry. They may use a line of questions similar to this: If a price 
response is made, is it likely the competitor will further cut its price? Can the fi rm continue 
to match sequential price cuts?
STRATEGIC POSITION
Price reductions by a competitor may be driven by a difference in competitive advantage. 
When a competitor has a cost advantage, its ability to reduce prices and remain profi table

is greater than the original fi rm’s ability to follow suit. Firms at a cost disadvantage 
have a higher strategic interest in raising industry-level prices—or at least not lowering 
them—than those with a cost advantage. As such, a fi rm may be better off averting a 
price war and granting market share concessions rather than entering into a war that it 
cannot win.
An example of this kind of industry makeover occurred in the steel industry when 
Nucor launched the use of mini-mills in 1989 to produce specifi c products at a low 
cost that targeted specifi c segments of the market. In the face of the cost advantages of
mini-mills for these specifi c products, larger integrated steel companies had to cede some 
market segments in the 1990s.
Another example can be found in the dynamic PC market. In the decades lead-
ing up to 2005, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Dell slugged it out, with Dell typically 
winning the price challenges. Dell had historically held a cost advantage in making 
PCs due to its direct-to-the-customer channel strategy, made-to-order inventory and
manufacturing process, and accelerated accounts-receivable-to-accounts-payable cash 
management. In contrast, companies like HP faced cost disadvantages in PC markets 
due to their retail-channel strategy, which was accompanied by higher inventory costs 
and slower payments from customers in comparison to the timing of payments to sup-
pliers. This enabled Dell to price aggressively in the PC market and take market share. 
Between 2005 and 2009, however, the tides changed. HP had developed a consulting 
arm within its organization and acquired EDS, a systems integration fi rm, to enable it to 
couple software sales with PCs.3 This granted HP more leeway than Dell to participate 
in bidding wars for big corporate PC contracts because HP could afford to reduce prices 
for PCs that it sells in combination with contracts for technical services and software, 
which have higher profi t margins than PCs.
As these examples indicate, it is important for executives to examine the possibility that 
a competitor has a competitive advantage with respect to the pricing action. If they do, 
they may be wise to avoid a price response and make a market share concession. If they 
don’t, it may signal the opportunity to attack.
Depending on a fi rm’s strategic position, there are varying strategies that it can follow, 
including matching the price, pricing lower than the competitor’s price, and accommodating
the lost sales while maintaining its price. See Exhibit 15-2 for a summary of potential
responses that a fi rm can take to a competitor’s price reduction.4

Outside of opportunism, there are strategic reasons for imitating a price reduction. Price 
may be a strategic focus of the fi rm, stripping out costs to serve a larger market at a lower 
price point and capture a signifi cant market share. When a fi rm determines that it is in its 
best interest to resolve the price-to-value tradeoff in favor of its customers, it should gauge 
the likely competitive response prior to executing its strategy.
PRICE AS A STRATEGIC FOCUS
Southwest, IKEA, and Wal-Mart all share a common focus of reducing costs and prices simul-
taneously to profi tably take market share and enter unserved and underserved markets. 
They are able to do this by carefully examining the points of value sought by the market 
and removing attributes and benefi ts that the market will forgo to achieve a lower price 
point. At times, they will also add new points of value that were previously unconsidered.
For example, IKEA, a furniture and home goods retailer, has in the past operated as a 
model fi rm for using price as a strategic focus. In designing a new product, IKEA would 
fi rst determine the target price and market need, from which all further decisions would 
be made. Product attributes, such as the overall design, the use of specifi c wood laminate 
fi nishing on specifi c surfaces, and fastener selection, would then follow from the need to 
deliver the product at a cost below the target price. The result would be a set of functional
products for home needs. Although IKEA’s products were not known for longevity
compared to products from high-end furniture stores, they were known for solving
immediate furnishing needs effectively.
IKEA’s cost containment fl owed throughout the design of the retailer’s operations as well. 
Suppliers would be selected through a competitive bidding process, parts of a specifi c dining 
set might be sourced from different suppliers, and even the fasteners might derive from Poland 
while the frame hails from Vietnam. Their focus on reducing costs, and hence profi t at a lower 
price point, also drove IKEA to rely on customers for co-creating much of the value. Custom-
ers would be given the task of picking up their own furniture rather than having it delivered. 
They were also responsible for assembling the furniture at home. Even in marketing, IKEA 
placed a heavy reliance on customer word-of-mouth to drive traffi c and subsequent sales.
Just as IKEA removed some attributes from the value proposition, it also created new 
ones. For instance, IKEA outlets were known for their well-lit retail space, large selection, 
and pleasant atmosphere, with complete room layouts to enable and encourage customer 
decision making. In contrast, other low-priced retailers were known for dank warehouses 
with a limited selection of items strewn about the fl oor in a seemingly random manner. 
While improving the shopping experience over its low-cost competitors did add some 
costs, it also greatly increased the attraction of IKEA to customers who otherwise would 
refrain from shopping altogether.
Competitors may try to copy a portion of the cost management techniques and price 
 targeting, but they face a diffi culty in creating a similar level of strategic fi t between resources 
necessary to match IKEA’s price point. This has enabled IKEA to enjoy a consistent cost ad-
vantage over competitors, leading to prices comparable to low-end furniture retailers while 
providing some points of differentiation that would attract some higher-end customers.
The use of price as a strategic focus can be an outcome from a highly customer-
oriented strategy. In this strategy, price targets are set according to customer willingness

to pay, rather than costs to produce. From price targets, fi rms like IKEA create cost 
targets. Most companies have operated from a manufacturing-and-cost orientation, 
from which prices are set. A customer-and-price orientation works in the exact oppo-
site direction. Prices determine costs when price is a strategic focus, rather than letting 
costs determine price.
When using price as a strategic focus in a radical form of customer orientation, the 
need and willingness to pay of customers determine every attribute of the fi rm’s operations 
and products. In such a focus, the fi rm manages its only value proposition by determining 
to enter a market only if the customer’s willingness to pay can be met profi tably with a
product that it can make and distribute at a lower cost. If not, fi rms like IKEA walk away 
from that specifi c market opportunity rather than try to convince customers to pay a 
higher price for the product.
GAUGING COMPETITIVE RESPONSE
In reducing prices or increasing the price-to-value tradeoffs faced by customers, 
 executives should gauge the response of their competitors.5 That is, if a company reduces 
price, will competitors react at all? What options will the competitor actively consider? 
Which option will the competitor most likely choose?
Two facts make this process effective: (1) Surveys show that most companies use 
 rudimentary analytical techniques in determining a competitive response and therefore 
their competitive responses will be somewhat predictable. (2) Most companies follow 
a predictable pattern in reacting to a competitor’s move; and therefore, executives can 
 anticipate a competitor’s future reactions by studying its past reactions.
Will the Competitor React at All?
In many situations, competitors will not react to a pricing action. Four lines of inquiry will 
enable executives to gauge the likelihood of a competitor response: (1) Will your rivals see 
your pricing action? (2) Will competitors feel threatened? (3) Will mounting a response be 
a priority? (4) Can your rivals overcome organizational inertia? 
(1) Will your rivals see your pricing actions? Most competitors rely on incomplete 
data to assess change in the marketplace. For example, Wal-Mart does not participate in 
the dominant market-tracking services in the United States, which is signifi cant because
Wal-Mart sells roughly 20 percent of grocery items purchased in the United States.
Similarly, smaller stores or stores outside a defi ned category may take pricing actions 
that are not documented by major market-tracking services. Because of these gaps in 
data, many fi rms will fail to notice the pricing actions of their competitors. One survey of
executives found that only 12 percent of the fi rms learned about a price change in time to 
prepare a preemptive response.
(2) Will competitors feel threatened? Even if a competitor sees a fi rm’s pricing actions, 
it may not feel threatened. Accordingly, that competitor will not think that mounting a 
response is worth the expense. Most organizations assess performance strictly against 
annual budgets. If the fi nancial goals in the budget can still be met despite a competitive 
pricing action, management will see the company as “on plan” and feel safe. Firms can use 
public statements, such as earning targets, security analysts’ estimates, or fi nancial returns, 
to gauge the competitor’s targets. If a pricing action will not encroach on the competitor’s 
fi nancial goals, it may not react.
(3) Will mounting a response be a priority? Your competitors already have an agenda 
in place before you take a pricing action. A competitor may be planning product launches, 
marketing campaigns, reorganizations, major acquisitions, plant openings, or cost
reduction efforts. If it were to respond to a pricing action, it might need to curtail some of 
these activities. The degree to which a competitor is already engaged in current strategic 
goals will limit its ability to respond to a pricing action.

(4) Can your rivals overcome organizational inertia? Even if a competitor’s management
wanted to react, its organization as a whole may resist. Executives must muster the will 
to react to known threats if the damage from the threat is not imminent. Also, whereas 
all competitors will notice a large move, companies overestimate the likelihood that a 
 medium to small action will be noticed. Thus the likelihood of no response in the real 
world is quite high.
What Options Will the Competitor Actively Consider?
An overwhelming majority of fi rms consider a maximum of four responses to a price 
change or new product launch, so it is reasonable for executives to develop an expecta-
tion of the potential responses to a price action. The single most common counteraction 
is to  introduce a “me-too” product or matching a price change, both of which are highly 
 obvious responses. A large portion of managers will consider what their business unit did 
the last time that it faced a similar situation. To a smaller degree, managers might consider 
the actions by other business units, seek board or expert advice, or defer to the specifi c 
experience of the executive in charge.
Which Options Will the Competitor Most Likely Choose?
A large number of competitors will not participate in an examination of their response 
based on game theory. They will consider only their direct response to a pricing action and 
fail to consider subsequent responses. If they do consider subsequent responses, they are 
very likely to consider no more than one stage of counterresponses. Very few will consider 
more than one round of responses by more than one competitor. As such, it is possible for 
executives to anticipate a competitor’s response to a price action.
When a competitor evaluates its options, it is likely to consider the fi nancial effects of dif-
ferent outcomes—that is, the effects of a price action and price response on short- and long-
term market share changes or short- and long-term earnings. Executives can apply their 
adversary’s decision-making process by using their own analytical techniques,  including the 
rounds of competition, to determine the options that they think a competitor will examine. 
In this process, executives can uncover the option that they can anticipate that competitors 
will perceive as the best, and therefore the one that competitors are most likely to choose.
Managing Price Actions
The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own ac-
cord before there are any actual hostilities. . . . It is best to win 
without fi ghting.

—Theodore Roosevelt
Because price wars are potentially extremely destructive, it is often best to reduce the 
potential for them. Furthermore, if a war has been initiated, fi rms may be able to act 
to limit its spread. Two techniques in particular have been widely demonstrated to
mitigate the potential of a pricing action to deliver negative repercussions. These are price
signaling and tit-for-tat pricing. Both of these techniques are designed to communicate to
competitors that it is in their best interest to compete on grounds other than just price.
PRICE SIGNALING
In price signaling, fi rms communicate a strategic pricing action to their competitors indi-
rectly. Direct communication with competitors regarding prices is a form of illegal collusion;

therefore fi rms cannot talk directly to each other about pricing decisions. However, commu-
nicating price decisions to markets in general is often viewed as a necessary market function 
to let customers know of a future price change or investors know of a potential revenue 
impact. Hence, fi rms may communicate a price action in a public forum, such as to the press 
or investors, with the intention of informing the market of a price change. In the process, 
they will also be signaling to competitors their strategic pricing action.
Price signaling can be used both for managing price reductions while limiting the
potential for the breakout of a war, and for encouraging prices to rise within an industry. It 
is used by both dominant and smaller industry players as a method to take price leadership 
and exhibit price followership.
There are two key requirements to signal price changes effectively: (1) The price change 
must be announced in a highly public forum; and (2) the reasons for the price action 
must be credible. To signal a price change to a competitor, the price actions should be
announced in a highly public forum. Signaling price actions to one’s competitors in the 
hopes that they will follow the lead or cede the battle requires competitors to hear the 
signal. As such, price signaling is mostly done in well-read periodicals, such as business 
newspapers like the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times, or magazines that dominate 
the relevant industry.
It is often best, although not required, to pre-announce price changes when price signaling. 
Courts generally accept the pre-announcements of price changes as a necessary means to 
inform shareholders and customers of future price levels. However, fi rms should be careful 
if they want to interpret this as carte-blanche permission to test different price actions and 
await competitor responses. “Testing the waters” announcements are far riskier from a legal 
perspective than announcing a plan and executing it. Even if the price action is subsequently 
revoked due to failure by competitors to follow, it is might be safer to follow through from 
a legal perspective.
In sending a price signal, fi rms should cite credible reasons for the price change. Industry-
wide input cost increases apply pressure to all competitors. Citing these cost increases as 
the cause of a price increase enables competitors to take the same price  increase because 
it is in their best interest to operate within a healthy industry. If the fi rm is reducing 
prices due to a change in market demands or a new cost capability, it should communi-
cate this as well so as to discourage an attempt by competitors to match that new lower 
price.
TIT-FOR-TAT PRICING
Tit-for-tat pricing is an extreme form of price followership in which a fi rm matches its 
competitor’s price actions at every stage of the game. If the competitor lowers its price, the 
fi rm lowers its own price as well. If the competitor raises its price, the fi rm follows suit. All 
price moves are done in response to the competitor’s price actions.
Tit-for-tat pricing removes price as a strategic dimension of competition. Done repeatedly, 
competitors will discover that any price move will simply be matched. Therefore, they will 
discover that lowering prices just hurts themselves, not to mention the industry health 
overall.
In responding to a price reduction by a competitor, fi rms can couple their price reduction 
with an announcement of their reasons for lowering the price as related to industrywide 
pricing pressure and its damage to profi tability. Once a competitor raises the price, fi rms can 
respond quickly with matching price increases to demonstrate their willingness to end the 
price war.
The point of tit-for-tat pricing isn’t to destroy enemies but to convince them that the 
battle is not worth fi ghting. It is a means to fi ght for a peaceful resolution to a price war 
in which the fi rm can fl ourish in the future.

Summary
• Rarely do companies enter a price war on purpose. The cost of a price war is 
inherently expensive, with the immediate loss of profi ts or, worse, mounting 
losses over time. The long-term benefi ts are doubtful, with a likely resurgence of 
competitive pressures once the war is over.
• The prisoner’s dilemma highlights the potential for an opportunistic pricing action to 
lead to an all-out price war that leaves all competitors within an industry worse off.
• Some industries are plagued by constant price pressures, while others compete in 
a relatively healthy pricing environment. The fi ve key structural drivers that lead 
to excessive price competition are (1) a lack of industry concentration, (2) low 
levels of managerial maturity, (3) high fi xed costs coupled with low marginal costs, 
(4) growth industries with the potential for economic savings to be generated as 
the industry matures, and (5) growth industries in which the potential exists for 
network externalities to drive customers to a handful of concentrated players as 
the industry matures.
• Competitive advantages can come from economies of scale, scope, or learning. 
Economies of scale refer to cost reductions that are derived from specialization or 
spreading the costs of fi xed assets over more units as the volume of production 
increases. Economies of scope are derived from the breadth of a fi rm’s activities, 
perhaps deriving from spreading the costs of fi xed assets over a wider variety 
of units. Economies of learning are derived from experience as measured by 
accumulated output. 
• In calculating the response to a competitor’s price reduction, executives should 
calibrate their actions after considering three issues: (1) What are the direct costs 
and direct benefi ts of responding in tandem to a competitor’s price move? (2) 
What are the likely secondary consequences from taking a price response? (3) Does 
that competitor have a strategic cost advantage that enables it to profi t at a lower 
industry price point?
• Besides opportunism, there are strategic reasons for imitating a price reduction. 
For instance, price may be a strategic focus of the fi rm, stripping out costs to serve 
a larger market at a lower price point and capture a signifi cant market share. 
• When a company determines it is in its best interest to improve the price-to-value 
tradeoff in favor of its customers, it should gauge the likely competitive response 
prior to executing this strategy. 
• Two techniques in particular have been widely demonstrated to mitigate 
the potential of a pricing action to deliver negative repercussions. These are 
price signaling and tit-for-tat pricing. Both of these techniques are designed 
to communicate to competitors that it is in their best interest to compete on 
dimensions other than price.
Sony vs. Microsoft Game Console Case Exercise
In 2007, Sony launched the PS3, the next-generation product to the PS2, into an already 
hotly contested gaming console market. Between 2007 and 2009, the Sony PS3 product 
line has been most comparable with the Microsoft Xbox product line. Within each of 
these product lines, different product versions differed chiefl y in hard drive capacity. Be-
tween these product lines, the Sony PS3 differed from the Microsoft Xbox chiefl y in offer-
ing HD Blu-ray video playing. Read the following reference articles concerning the gaming 
console market (listed under item 8) and address the following questions.

Product Life Cycle Pricing
• How do unit sales and profi ts evolve over the product life cycle?
• How does customer behavior evolve over the course of the product life cycle?
• Can prices increase over the course of the product life cycle?
• How must the emphasis of pricing policy change over the course of the product life 
cycle?
• Stretch Question: How does the product life cycle inform pricing strategy?
T
he product life cycle is a useful concept for understanding industry market tra-
jectories.1 In its most strategic form (which is the form we will consider in this 
chapter), the product life cycle refers to entire product categories rather than 
individual products, brands, or fi rms within that product category. According to the 
product life cycle concept, product categories pass through phases of introduction, 
growth, maturity, and eventual decline, much like a biological ecosystem. In each phase 
of the product life cycle, specifi c characteristics of the market take form. Changes in 
market dynamics between the different product life cycle stages in turn drive a neces-
sary change in marketing strategy, and more specifi cally pricing strategy, to capture the 
market profi tably.
Product life cycles are understood as a measure of industry behavior with respect to 
time. The behavior under investigation may be measured in terms of revenue, market 
saturation, unit demand, or profi ts, and it is usually plotted on the vertical axis. Units of

time, be it months, years, decades, or perhaps even centuries, are all on the horizontal axis. 
See Exhibit 16-1 for a purely qualitative, although conceptually representative, plot of the 
product life cycle. 
Although Exhibit 16-1 represents each phase as having equal duration, most phases 
during the product life cycle are of differing durations. Moreover, before a product is 
launched and sales begin, a fi rm may spend years to decades in research and development. 
As such, the product category’s profi t at launch will be negative. 
Once launched, the introduction of a new product may take months to years to fi nd its 
market. Once a product has found its market, the growth phase is known to last as short 
as months and as long as decades. Maturity is usually, although not always, a prolonged 
state of affairs. For instance, synthetic laundry detergent like Tide, introduced in 1947, 
is currently still in the mature phase. Meanwhile, small stuffed animals such as Beanie 
Babies by Ty hit their heyday between 1995 and 1999 and then moved back into relative 
obscurity. The decline period can be as short as months, such as was seen in the market 
for standard metallic stents when they were displaced by drug-eluting stents, or decades 
followed by fi nding a niche use, such as in the case of coal locomotives, which are still used 
for amusement parks and specifi c applications.

As shown in Exhibit 16-1, industry revenues start low during the introductory phase, 
increase rapidly during the growth phase, stabilize or grow at the rate of population 
growth during the maturity phase, and decrease during the decline phase.
Also shown in Exhibit 16-1 is a standard plot of industry profi ts over the course of a 
product life cycle. During the introductory phase, industry-level profi ts are suspected to be 
generally low, if not altogether negative, as shown in the plot. Not only are sales volumes 
low during the introductory phase, thus limiting the profi t potential, but also companies 
will rationally spend disproportionately in product development and marketing to invest 
in the future market. It is also suspected that industry profi ts will generally rise rapidly and 
perhaps peak during the growth phase due to a low level of competition. In the mature 
phase, industry profi ts are suspected to stabilize, if not decrease slightly, as competition 
increases and competitors begin to apply price pressures on one another. Finally, during 
a market decline, industry profi ts are suspected to plummet as companies are forced to 
withdraw due to insuffi cient revenue.
From a pricing perspective, however, scant attention has been paid to price changes 
over the course of the product life cycle. What is shown in Exhibit 16-1 is a band of prices 
that one might expect to fi nd during the product life cycle.
During the introductory and growth phases, the price of entry-level products within 
the category may be expected to decline rapidly as economies of scale, scope, and learning 
or potential network externalities enable companies to price at lower points and attract 
larger market volumes. Once at maturity and through the decline stage, price levels of 
entry-level products within the category may be expected to stabilize or decline relative 
to infl ation at a somewhat less rapid pace as further cost savings, and therefore potential 
price reductions, become more elusive.
While prices of entry-level products may decline, the price on higher-end products within 
the category is not constrained to decline. Higher-end products may become cheaper, but 
this is not necessarily true in all cases. They may hold steady or even continually become 
more expensive. For instance, LCD TVs were fi rst marketed around $4,000 for a small 
screen in 2003. While similar-sized screens plummeted by roughly a factor of 10 within 
three years, new LCD TVs were introduced with larger screens, better sound, and other 
features. In 2006, the upper end of the LCD TV market had hit $150,000.2 Prices at the 
upper end of the market may increase precisely because new viable market niches become 
profi table to serve at the upper end of the market as the overall market grows. Even during 
the decline of a product category, specifi c niches of the market may be willing to pay a high 
price for products while the market in general may have a low willingness to pay.
What follows is a description of the pricing challenge during each phase of the product 
life cycle. Changes in the pricing challenge result from changes in the market makeup or, 
more specifi cally, changes in the characteristics of customers that are associated with each 
phase in the product life cycle.
Introduction
During the introduction phase, a revolutionary product is launched, which creates an entirely 
new market. Although the term “revolutionary” is commonly applied to many products by 
marketers promoting their newest product formulations, truly revolutionary products are 
rare. Revolutionary products represent only a small fraction of the new products on the 
market at any given time, and many researchers with a more critical bent would argue that 
truly revolutionary products are launched sporadically on time scales of once per every few 
years, if not decades.
Examples of radically revolutionary products include locomotives and railways for 
transporting goods, information technology for managing records, and cellular phone 
systems for communication. Radically revolutionary products not only created a new

market, but they also changed entire industries that were not directly related to the
product launch, as well as customer behaviors as markets adapted these products. Less 
radical but no less revolutionary are products ranging from aluminum cans to hybrid corn 
seed and advanced metering infrastructure. The launch of these revolutionary products 
may have affected large swaths of the general public, but only a handful of industries were 
affected directly.
From a strategic sense, revolutionary products are products that satisfy a market 
need in a manner that hitherto had never been considered or was considered impossible.
Revolutionary products may address an existing market need in an entirely different
manner than other products on the market, or they may address a new market demand 
that had previously been considered unaddressable.
For instance, advanced metering infrastructure solutions were initially launched as 
a means to read residential electric meters without needing a human meter reader. In 
this application, the market need to read meters existed prior to the launch of advanced 
metering infrastructure solutions, yet the remote and automatic collection of meter 
data was not possible prior to the introduction of low-cost wireless communication 
solutions. As the market evolved over two decades, initial solutions in the advanced 
metering infrastructure market also evolved to address entirely new market needs, such 
as the speedy identifi cation of power outages or demand-response market structures. 
Prior to the introduction of advanced metering infrastructure, power outages were 
identifi ed primarily through customers notifying the power company of an outage. 
After the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure solutions, utilities were 
able to pinpoint the source of a power outage and remedy the situation quicker. Similarly, 
prior to the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, utilities were limited in their 
ability to charge different rates depending on the time of day. Following their implementation, 
prices for electricity could be adjusted based on the time of day, overall demand level, or 
any other factor allowed by regulatory authorities.
Revolutionary products are disruptive in nature. The introduction of trains trans-
formed the transportation industry, disrupting established industry structures focused on 
transport via canal or horse and wagon. Similarly, the introduction of broadcast television 
disrupted the previously established structure focused on radio broadcasts. More recently, 
the Internet has disrupted established business models of newspapers and other media, 
telephony and other communication technology, and postal services and other document 
delivery products.
Launching revolutionary products is a fundamentally different task from marketing exist-
ing products or launching products that are enhancements to existing products. They enter 
markets that did not exist before. As such, customers are unfamiliar with the new product 
category and their buying habits are nonexistent. Consequently, the analytical rigor for pric-
ing the product is limited, while the freedom to establish the price structure is relatively wide.
Revolutionary products succeed by fulfi lling a latent demand. Latent demand implies that 
the desire for the solution to a problem existed prior to the launch of the product, but that 
no viable solution existed. That is, the demand existed but could not express itself because 
no product existed that could fulfi ll the demand. Once the product is introduced, the latent 
demand becomes activated and is expressed in the form of purchases. In unleashing the
latent demand, a new product category is created.
The concept of latent demand in relation to expressed demand can be considered as 
analogous to the physical concepts of potential energy and kinetic energy. A ball held at the 
top of the hill has potential energy that can be converted to kinetic energy once it is released 
and begins to roll down the hill. Similarly, a customer with a seemingly unattainable goal 
has latent demand for a means to reach that goal. Once that means becomes accessible by 
the introduction of a revolutionary product, the customer makes a purchase, converting 
this latent demand into an expressed demand.

For instance, the iPod and iTunes are solutions to the desire to access music electronically 
and portably. MP3 players, the Internet, and other technology existed prior to the introduc-
tion of iTunes and iPods, but never before were they assembled in such a seamless manner to 
enable easy customer purchase and enjoyment of music. In this sense, customers had a latent 
desire to purchase music by the song and carry it around conveniently, but previously they 
were unable to do so. With iTunes and iPods, the market expressed its desires, converting 
latent demand into expressed demand.
Similarly, Zipcar and other fractional car ownership services enable urbanites to access 
cars without actually owning them. Prior to Zipcar, urban dwellers in premier cities with 
functional mass transit would need to purchase a car for infrequent trips for large items 
or to travel beyond the urban core. Yet, a majority of the time, these urban dwellers would 
see their car sit idle in an expensive parking lot as they used mass transit, bicycles, or 
walking to commute to work or meet most daily transportation needs. With fractional car 
ownership, Zipcar customers have access to an automobile for the brief periods that they 
need them, and they do not have to assume the costs or responsibilities of full ownership 
such as gas and insurance. (Zipcar estimates that each single Zipcar serves the needs that 
would have otherwise required twenty individual cars.) Furthermore, individual Zipcars 
are made available at hundreds of sites at neighborhood parking lots within a single city 
on a per-hour basis, making them far more convenient to access, and at a lower overall 
cost, than traditional car rental services. Zipcar tapped into the latent demand for infre-
quent car mobility without the hassles of car ownership.
Another example can be found in the energy market. The market would like to fi nd an 
economical means to tap into renewable energy sources, and thus there is a latent demand 
for green energy. In the absence of further advances in science and technology, we have 
maintained a global dependence on fossil fuels. In the coming years and decades, we can 
anticipate a new solution to be developed as the destructive impact of our reliance on 
fossil fuels becomes increasingly apparent and the global supplies of fossil fuels dwindle. 
Once it does, our latent demand for green energy will be expressed.
The focal marketing challenge during the introductory phase of the product life cycle is 
gaining critical mass. Companies launching a revolutionary product must identify which 
segment within the marketplace will benefi t from its features and derive value from its use. 
They must understand the value proposition from that segment’s specifi c viewpoint. In 
addition, they must educate that segment on the value that they will derive from the new 
product. All this must occur to capture the initial market. 
CUSTOMERS OF INTRODUCTORY MARKETS
In the introduction phase of the product life cycle, customers have been characterized as 
Tinkerers and Visionaries, where Tinkerers constitute most of the early market and Vision-
aries constitute most the latter market during the introductory phase.3 These two groups 
evaluate revolutionary products for entirely different properties. As such, they also exhibit 
different criteria when determining their willingness to pay, which in turn determines the 
company’s price latitude.
Tinkerers
Tinkerers are people who appreciate a new product due to its revolutionary properties 
themselves. They are the very small segment of society that enthusiastically tracks tech-
nological and product developments. They primarily derive enjoyment out of watch-
fully participating in the evolution of technology and products overall. Tinkerers have 
a proclivity to “toy” with new products rather than solve business problems with the 
product. As such, tinkerers have been known by many names, such as “enthusiasts” and 
“hobbyists,” as well.

Product Life Cycle Pricing

When Tinkerers evaluate a new product, they seek to explore its properties, capabilities, 
and uses. They are often entranced by the architecture of the product, and compare products 
on the basis of their artful integration of technology with tangibility.
When they have an opportunity to interact with a new product, they are willing to play 
with it to make it do things that the originator may not have had in mind. In doing so, they 
are developing an expanded sense of value for the new product, and therefore they are 
co-creating the future market for the product. As such, Tinkerers are an important market 
segment to court, for they help entrepreneurial endeavors reach their goal.
In terms of behavior, Tinkerers are an interesting breed. They have been described as 
highly factually driven, eschewing lofty stories and instead seeking detailed evidence to 
evaluate the new product. When they have a diffi culty with a new product, they will seek 
to bypass the fi rm’s customer service, sales, and marketing people altogether and desire to 
work directly with technical departments to resolve a challenge.
Within organizations in business-to-business markets, Tinkerers are not typically key 
decision makers, and their infl uence over budgets is highly limited. Furthermore, they tend 
not to follow “value-added” arguments and instead seek to have access to technology
“at cost.”
From a pricing perspective, companies have an incentive to get new products to Tinkerers 
due to their willingness to co-create the future market for the product.  Unfortunately, they 
also face the challenge of needing to price their product low to capture the Tinkerer segment, 
but in doing so, they will be artifi cially setting the reference price for the product too low 
for future sales. Doing this will drive the fi rm to forgo potential profi ts that may be earned 
in later product life cycle phases. To manage this divergent set of goals, some fi rms have 
attempted to distribute loaner kits and beta products—products specifi cally designed and 
priced for the Tinkerer segment but not quite appropriate for the general market. Usually, 
such Tinkerer-focused versions of revolutionary products are launched with stiff limitations 
on use or requirements for returning after a short examination period.
Visionaries 
Visionaries are people who are seeking a quantum leap forward in addressing a challenge. 
They are constantly searching for revolutionary products that will help them achieve their 
desired goals. Unlike Tinkerers, Visionaries primarily derive enjoyment from revolutionary 
products by using them to solve a challenge or set of challenges in an entirely different man-
ner than has hitherto been accomplished. In terms of market size, Visionaries constitute a 
small fraction of the potential market, but they are a much more signifi cant segment than 
Tinkerers. Visionaries constitute the Early Adapters.
When Visionaries consider a revolutionary new product, they are not looking to make an 
incremental improvement but rather a strategic breakthrough in solving a problem. If they 
are a business customer, they are seeking an order-of-magnitude return on investment, not a 
standard small percentage of improvement with a long-term payback. They are driven by a 
dream, a goal to take a quantum leap forward in how things are done. Visionaries want to 
go where no human has gone before in terms of solving problems.
Visionaries are characterized as individuals with the insight to match an emerging 
solution to a strategic opportunity. They have the temperament to translate that insight 
into a high-visibility, high-risk project. Moreover, they have access to cash to pay for a 
revolutionary new product.
In business markets, Visionaries are necessarily senior executives. Visionaries require both 
charisma and the necessary power required to get the rest of the organization behind their 
decision to implement a risky but promising new technology. In approaching the purchase 
decision, they are willing to take the necessary risks with the revolutionary product but also 
will seek to identify routes to mitigate these risks. For instance, Visionaries in business mar-
kets have been described as highly project-oriented, implementing the revolutionary product

in phases, where each phase is associated with a project milestone and potential exit. If a 
milestone is completed successfully, Visionaries may seek to productize that phase of the 
deliverable into a subproduct within the new product category.
Visionaries are known to be less price-sensitive than Tinkerers, but more results-
sensitive. Their results sensitivity derives from their purchasing goals. Visionaries are looking 
for great improvements with overwhelmingly signifi cant value to compensate them for the 
risks they are taking by purchasing a revolutionary, but untested and unproven, product. 
Upon success, they are willing to serve as a highly visible reference because the success of 
the product refl ects not only on the revolutionary product’s strengths but also the ability 
of the Visionary to recognize the strengths and exploit them. So long as the value is there, 
Visionaries are suspected to have the willingness to pay.
PRICING IN INTRODUCTORY MARKETS
Executives launching a revolutionary new product into the introductory market will 
have tremendous pricing latitude but will face two very diffi cult pricing challenges:
(1) What should the price level be? (2) What should the price structure be?
In introductory markets, there may be no directly comparable products to serve as 
points of comparison. Moreover, the introductory market previously didn’t exist prior to 
the product launch, and even after launch, the market will remain small for a while. Thus, 
it is unrealistic to use most econometric and customer-oriented research methods with any 
accuracy. Most importantly, the customers within the potential market have no experience 
with the product and, in general, will have a poor understanding of the potential value of 
the product. Thus, customer-reported willingness to pay is likely to yield a wide array of 
potential price points with little apparent logic and poor correlation with value.
To price a product within an introductory market, executives are usually best served 
by using exchange value models such as in the case of the Cordis drug eluting stent that 
was discussed in Chapter 1. The other dominant price-setting methodologies are funda-
mentally ill-suited for introductory markets. Customers are unfamiliar with the product 
category and uneducated regarding the benefi ts of specifi c features. Therefore, in general 
they will be ill-suited to make rational tradeoffs required for conjoint analysis techniques 
to yield meaningful results. As for economic price optimization techniques, these rely on a 
historic pattern of price changes and volume changes that does not exist for products that, 
prior to their launch, also did not exist.
Exchange value models rely on internal management’s assessment of the value of a 
revolutionary product. One method for generating this model is to conduct an As Is/ To Be 
analysis. In this type of analysis, management will develop an introspective understanding 
of the process in which customers solve a problem on the day before they purchased the
revolutionary product, and then again on the day after. This enables them to develop a
picture of the implications of their revolutionary product and hence the economic
exchange value.
From the exchange value model, executives may be able to develop an understanding of 
optimal price structures as well. In this exercise, executives will be searching for metrics that 
enable the price to track to the value that it delivers to different customer segments. 
Research into the habits of highly successful entrepreneurs indicates that companies 
launching revolutionary products are likely to be best served by pricing products at the 
upper end of the potential price spectrum generated from the exchange value calculator.4 
Part of the logic behind this approach to pricing high derives from the characteristics of 
the introductory market. The more temperamentally cautious market segments are un-
likely to purchase a new revolutionary product regardless of its price. Visionaries, on the 
other hand, are the more realistic market segment to be captured, and they are not known 
for stinginess in spending; they are only demanding in terms of value delivered. Hence,

highly successful entrepreneurs tend to price revolutionary products at the upper end of 
the potential price range. While entrepreneurs cannot succeed by overpricing the product 
in comparison to the value that it delivers, they also shouldn’t be afraid to price a revolu-
tionary product at a level that refl ects its potential value to customers.
Growth
The growth phase of the product life cycle is marked with rapid changes in every
dimension of the newly emerged market. New customers enter the market and adopt the 
products within the emergent category, leading to multiple market segments. Accompanying 
the entrance of more customers into the market are new competitors attracted by the 
profi t potential of the new category. Competitors will explore different confi gurations and 
possibilities within the product category, leading to product proliferation, feature differen-
tiation, and price-point variations. In addition, the product category will have passed the 
point of being revolutionary and begin a rapid evolutionary trajectory.
Evolutionary products are products in which specifi c features or benefi ts are added or 
subtracted from the core product. Product evolutions may come in the form of varying 
styles, designs, or types that satisfy different customer desires. They may also come in the 
form of feature differentiation, in which capabilities of the product are altered to satisfy 
specifi c needs of customer segments.
The rapid evolutionary nature of products in growth markets is supported by the con-
current entrance of both competitors and customers. As competitors develop new products 
for the market, they also expand the value points for different customers. By expanding 
the points of value delivered by products within the category, more customers are in-
duced to purchase. When suffi cient customers with differing tastes have entered, market 
 segmentation becomes viable because it becomes profi table to serve specifi c market niches 
rather than the mass market as a whole. Also, the development of market niches encour-
ages still more competitors to enter. It is a virtuous cycle of growth as both companies and 
customers derive value from the newly emerged product category.
In the growth phase of the product life cycle, fi rms may begin to realize cost savings as 
their business grows. These cost savings may derive from economies of scale, the reduc-
tion of production costs with increases in volume; scope, the reduction of production 
costs related to increases in the scope of business operations; or learning, the reduction of 
production costs related to improvements in manufacturing gleaned from experience. The 
cost savings not only enable fi rms to earn higher profi ts potentially, but also enable lower 
prices that further favor market growth.
In the growth phase, network externalities may emerge that enable fi rms to aggregate cus-
tomers and rapidly improve their relative revenue standing. Network externalities may derive 
from peer-to-peer interactions with customers that are facilitated when all customers share 
a common technology, as happened with email communications, word processing, spread-
sheets, and presentations during the 1990s. They may also derive from the participation of 
partners within the market, as has happened with software application developers that made 
products for specifi c computing, gaming, and mobile handset operating systems. These net-
work externalities may enable specifi c competitors to succeed while others wither away.
The anticipation of realizing signifi cant cost or revenue effects in the future maturity 
phase of the product life cycle can place excessive downward pressure on prices during 
the growth phase of the product life cycle. On the cost side, the anticipation of economies 
of scale, scope, or learning can encourage fi rms to use low prices as a means to generate 
the required economies. On the revenue side, the anticipation of network externalities that 
drive a disproportionate amount of the revenue to a single competitor or a small handful 
of industry competitors can also can encourage companies to use low prices as a means to 
generate the required customer mass.

Product Life Cycle Pricing
CUSTOMERS OF GROWTH MARKETS
In the growth phase of the product life cycle, customers have been characterized as Early 
Majority, followed by the Late Majority and Laggards. The following sections describe 
these three segments.
Early Majority
The Early Majority segment consists of customers who seek incremental improvements 
and appreciate the new product category for its ability to deliver value with manage-
able risk. They are noted as being highly value-sensitive and reasonably price-sensitive. 
Purchase decisions by the Early Majority are not driven by costs alone, but more by the 
difference between the value that they will derive and the price that they must pay to gain 
that value.
In business markets, the Early Majority usually is made up of people of CEO rank. 
They will have developed a belief that “leading edge” often means “bleeding edge,” and so 
they have refrained from market participation in the introductory phase. However, their 
drive for building and capturing value will induce them into market participation once the 
product category has emerged from the more experimental introduction phase to the more 
evolutionary growth phase.
Chief executives will seek to limit the risks that they take with revolutionary prod-
ucts. As such, they will desire to use standardization and rely on a minority of suppliers 
to deliver turnkey solutions. In interacting with suppliers, they will be concerned with 
all aspects of the purchasing relationship, including supplier staying power, aftermarket 
support, and anticipation of future product enhancements and complementary products. 
Some of these aspects in supplier selection may create a level of network externalities as 
customers use their own competitors to help select market winners. 
The wide scope of responsibility of CEOs will drive them to consider numerous impli-
cations of the new product category, such as organizational and process changes required 
to reap value from the product implementation.
Late Majority and Laggards
The Late Majority and Laggards segments include customers who would have preferred 
that the new product had not come into existence but have been forced by reality to adapt 
to the product. In essence, they like tradition and continuity and hold some disdain for
discontinuous innovation.
In purchasing decisions, the Late Majority and Laggards are picky, reluctant buyers. 
They seek products that meet their specifi c needs, preferring single-function products and 
showing little interest in fancy features. Once they have what works for them, they will tend 
to stick with it and exhibit a reasonable level of brand loyalty. They have low tolerance 
for risk and fundamentally want the product to function like a reliable refrigerator: Open 
door, lights on; close door, lights off.
The Late Majority and Laggard customers are noted as being highly price-sensitive 
because they hold limited expectations of deriving improvements with the new product.
PRICING IN GROWTH MARKETS
Executives operating in growth markets will have less pricing latitude than in the intro-
ductory market, but they will also benefi t from better pricing accuracy and practices. This 
will affect the methods used to price products, as well as the potential to explore new price 
structures for capturing customers.
In growth markets, customers will have greater familiarity with the product category 
than they did during the introductory market. This enables customers to make informed

tradeoffs between different product features and anticipate the benefi ts derived from alter-
native product confi gurations. Furthermore, the number of customers participating in the 
market increases, enabling statistical customer research–based methodologies to deliver 
reasonably reliable metrics of customer preferences. As such, customer perception–based 
pricing methodologies, such as the conjoint analysis explored in the pricing of mango juice 
in Chapter 3, can be used for setting reasonably accurate prices.
Exchange value models developed within the introductory phase shift in importance 
from enabling price setting into becoming a sales tool for communicating the value of 
participating in the market. While they still predict an accurate range of acceptable prices, 
the variance in price points generated from exchange value models can be reduced greatly 
through conjoint analysis. As such, competitors in growth markets usually shift their 
price-setting techniques to customer preference–based methodologies.
New price structures are usually explored in growth markets. Competitors may begin to 
explore add-ons and versioning as means to capture a wider variety of market segments, 
as was executed by Intuit in the late 1990s as it launched both a versioning strategy with
different levels of Quicken Home Finance and an add-on strategy with Turbo Tax. They 
may also begin to unbundle products that were previously bundled to serve the Late
Majority and Laggards segments. Unbundling has been seen in the U.S. mobile market in 
the fi rst decade of the twenty-fi rst century, in which the market that was initially domi-
nated by postpaid plans with long-term contracts in exchange for “free” mobile handsets, 
evolved to offer simplifi ed prepaid plans with the separate purchase of mobile handsets.
Price levels within growth markets generally decline, but not every product with a 
growth market will necessarily be priced lower than the revolutionary products of the in-
troductory market. Downward price pressure will be driven by the entrance of new com-
petitors and potentially supported by lower cost structures. Upward price movements will 
be made possible by the expansion of the market to include different market segments, 
some of which will have a higher willingness to pay in exchange for the delivery of greater 
benefi ts and value.
INTERTEMPORAL PRICE DISCRIMINATION
Between the introductory and growth phases of the product life cycle, prices of entry-level 
products within the new category will often drop. This phenomenon can be ascribed to a 
pricing technique known as intertemporal price discrimination.
Intertemporal price discrimination is a form of price discrimination that enables a fi rm 
to capture value from those who value it the most. In intertemporal price discrimination, 
time itself acts as the segmentation hedge. Early customers in a new product category, 
such as Visionaries and the Early Majority, are suspected to be less price-sensitive than 
later customers, such as the Late Majority and Laggards. Executives can use this insight 
to price a product at a high level initially and sequentially reduce the price as new market 
segments enter the market.
Intertemporal price discrimination is similar to, but distinct from, price skimming. 
While prices may move in a similar manner, the drivers behind the two strategies are dif-
ferent. Price skimming is defi ned as pricing high relative to competing products within the 
category. At the launch of a new product category, there are no competing products; there-
fore, it is impossible to discuss relative price differentials in introductory markets. Price 
skimming can occur within growth markets as competitors enter, but it is an inadequate 
concept for explaining the intertemporal price discrimination and price-level movements 
observed between introductory and growth markets.
Intertemporal price discrimination raises an intriguing academic question known as the 
Coase problem.5 Rational consumers may anticipate a future reduction in price correctly 
and therefore postpone their purchases. If they do, companies launching a product will not

Product Life Cycle Pricing
only suffer from lower profi ts due to an inability to price-discriminate, but may also fail 
to gain the initial traction required to achieve critical market mass. Hence, in a rational 
market, time segmentation would not be possible.
One solution to the Coase problem arose from considering heterogeneity in the mar-
ket. As with other segmentation methods, difference in customer preferences is required 
to explain variations in prices. Economic arguments such as that which led to the Coase 
problem, based on the market as a whole, fail to explain realistic phenomena of markets 
with demand heterogeneity. Some customers will value having the new product fi rst and 
will be willing to pay a premium for that privilege, while others will value knowing that 
they are purchasing a popular product and purchase later in the product life cycle and 
with an expectation of paying a lower price.
Maturity
In the mature phase of the product life cycle, demand growth, competitor turbulence, and 
rapid product evolution are replaced with more predictable industry dynamics. Further 
market growth is limited as product penetration reaches saturation. Rather than attract-
ing new customer segments to the market, the market grows through overall increase of 
economic productivity and welfare or of the general population. While products continue 
to evolve, further product modifi cations tend to be less radical than that seen in the earlier 
stages of the product life cycle. The nature of competition will have been established, and 
fi rms will often pursue one of the more common competitive strategies of cost leadership, 
product differentiation, or niche marketing.6
Accuracy in price setting in mature markets improves due to better understanding of 
the market. Customer preference techniques such as conjoint continue to generate relevant 
prices in both consumer and business markets of suffi cient size. For most mature markets, 
customer preference techniques will dominate price-setting challenges. In some more 
commodity-oriented industries, economic price optimization may become viable. With 
a reasonable track record of products within the market, it becomes possible for pricing 
managers to track historical variations between prices and volumes and develop statisti-
cally reliable correlations. As such, they can construct meaningful metrics of elasticity of 
demand, a required data point for conducting economic price optimization.
Price structures established in early product life cycle phases become somewhat more 
rigid during the mature phase. Customers begin to expect a standard price structure 
and select suppliers based on specifi c aspects of the structure. Meanwhile, competitors 
develop business models, processes, and organizations that are supportive and rely upon 
the established structure.
The rigidity of established price structures may create an opportunity for a strategic 
blow to competitors if a new price structure can be devised that profi tably gains customer 
acceptance. An example of a price structure change creating dramatic strategic advances in 
mature markets can be seen in the airline market. American Airlines fi rst introduced yield 
management into a somewhat mature airline industry in the 1980s. Its ability to adopt the 
yield management price structure evolved from the U.S. airline deregulation and advances 
in information technology and computerizing booking. When American Airlines switched 
to yield management, it achieved a dramatic increase in revenue per seat mile, which
enabled it to solidify its position as an industry leader.
During the mature phase, the pressure to improve prices shifts the pricing challenge from 
a focus on establishing price structures and setting price levels and toward the importance of 
managing price variances. Due to competitive pressures and customer heterogeneity, coupon-
ing, discounting, and price promotions all become more common practices. Pricing organiza-
tions are developed to manage price variances better, yielding an incremental improvement 
in profi t capturing. The development of price variance management organizations is typically

accompanied by data management and analysis systems that automate some of the discount 
management techniques described in various chapters throughout this book.
Overall, industry-level profi ts are suspected to come under pressure during the
mature phase of the product life cycle. The specifi c competitors may stabilize, but each will 
fi ght dearly for a single market share point. As such, companies will face price pressures 
throughout the mature phase of the market. Companies may also take steps to manage 
industry-level prices, mitigate the probability of future price wars, and manage price wars 
that fl are up over time. 
During the mature phase, companies may also enjoy some new sources of profi tability. Cost 
advantages deriving from economies of scale, scope, and learning can be captured during the 
mature phase. Furthermore, some pressure is removed from innovation and can be shifted 
to process improvements that drive cost reduction or marketing improvements that drive 
revenue growth. However, in the long term, it is believed that competition squeezes prices 
toward the marginal costs, and further cost reductions will become elusive, reducing the 
potential to capture large profi ts.
Decline
Eventually, a product may become outdated as new products are introduced. In this 
case, the product category will go through decline. For instance, the industry for making
stagecoaches and saddles, once common products throughout the western United States, 
declined rapidly after the advent of the automobile. However, not all industries will face 
the decline stage of the product life cycle. Demand for clean water is not anticipated to 
decrease during the span of the biological existence of advanced life forms. 
When markets are facing decline, industry competitors can choose one of three strate-
gies: Harvest, Consolidate, and Focus.7 In a Harvest strategy, a company will slowly exit the 
market while extracting the remaining profi ts that it can from customers. During this period, 
the company will not invest in any plant or process improvements. A company executing a 
Harvest strategy can be helped out of the industry through an appropriate merger. 
In a Consolidate strategy, a company will seek to become the last one serving the indus-
try. Consolidation strategies often rely on establishing or maintaining a low-cost position 
through economies of scale or technological improvements. Consolidators often become 
a natural acquirer of Harvesters. 
The third strategy executed during an industry decline, Focus, is supported by companies 
that are able to better serve the needs of a specifi c market niche that is anticipated to last. 
Companies executing a Focus strategy will exit areas of weakness and invest in areas
of strength. Their strength may derive from advantages in cost, technology, customer 
relationship, or other strategic resource advantages.
While prices during declining markets tend to be volatile, it is not possible to make an a 
priori statement regarding the direction of all prices. In most industries, general competitive 
pressures may drive prices lower. In some industries, increased scarcity or the relegation 
of a product to a specifi c high-value niche demand may actually enable prices to increase. 
Summary
• Product categories are observed to pass through phases of introduction, growth, 
maturity, and eventual decline. This cycle is referred to as the product life cycle. 
Each phase of the product life cycle can be associated with specifi c growth patterns, 
customer characteristics, and pricing challenges. 
• Over the product life cycle, industry revenues are observed to start low during the 
introductory phase, increase rapidly during the growth phase, stabilize or grow at

the rate of population growth during the maturity phase, and decrease during the 
decline phase.
• Over the product life cycle, industry profi ts are observed to be mostly negative 
during the introductory phase, increase rapidly during the growth phase toward 
a maximum, stabilize or decline slightly during the maturity phase, and decrease 
rapidly during decline.
• During the introduction phase, a revolutionary product is launched that creates 
an entirely new market. Revolutionary products are products that satisfy a market 
need in a manner that hitherto had never been considered. 
• Often, revolutionary products succeed by fulfi lling a latent demand. Latent demand 
implies that the desire for the solution to a problem existed prior to the launch of 
the product, but that no viable solution existed.
• In the introduction phase of the product life cycle, customers have been 
characterized as Tinkerers and Visionaries, where Tinkerers constitute most of 
the earlier market and Visionaries constitute most of the later market during the 
introductory phase. Tinkerers are people who appreciate the new product on the 
basis of their revolutionary properties themselves. Visionaries are people who are 
seeking to deliver a quantum leap forward in terms of solving a challenge, and they 
are constantly searching for revolutionary products that will help them achieve 
their desired goals.
• Executives launching a revolutionary new product into the introductory market 
will have tremendous pricing latitude. To price a product within an introductory 
market, executives are best served by using exchange value calculators. From the 
exchange value model, executives may also be able to develop an understanding of 
optimal price structures as well. 
• In the growth phase of the product life cycle, customers have been characterized 
as Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. The Early Majority group consists 
of customers who seek incremental improvements and appreciate the new product 
category for its ability to deliver value with manageable risk. Late Majority and 
Laggards include customers who would have preferred that the new product not 
have come into existence but have been forced by reality to adapt to the product. 
• Executives operating in growth markets will have less pricing latitude than in the 
introductory market, but they will also enjoy the benefi t of better pricing accuracy 
and practices. Customer perception–based pricing methodologies, such as conjoint 
analysis, can be used for setting reasonably accurate prices during this phase. 
• In the mature phase of the product life cycle, demand growth, competitor 
turbulence, and rapid product evolution are replaced with more predictable 
industry dynamics. Customer preference techniques such as conjoint continue to 
generate relevant prices in both consumer and business markets of suffi cient size. 
In more commodity-oriented industries, economic price optimization may become 
viable. 
• During the mature phase, the pressure to improve prices shifts the pricing challenge 
toward a focus on managing price variances.
• When markets are facing decline, industry competitors can choose one of three 
strategies: Harvest, Consolidate, and Focus. In a Harvest strategy, a company 
will slowly exit the market while extracting the remaining profi ts that it can from 
customers. In a Consolidate strategy, a company will seek to become the last one

Amazon Kindle Case Exercise
The e-book reader market was initiated with the Sony Reader in 2006, but it didn’t take 
off in the United States until Amazon launched the Kindle in November 2007. Since then, 
Barnes & Noble entered the e-book reader market with the Nook in November 2009, and 
more recently, Apple introduced the iPad in April 2010. Read the following reference arti-
cles concerning the e-reader market listed under item 8 and address the following questions:
 1. How many Sony Readers were estimated to have been sold by the time of the 
launch of the Amazon Kindle?
 2. What was the initial launch price of the Amazon Kindle, and how did the price and

Bass Diﬀ usion Model
Researchers have constructed quantitative models of the market dynamics during the
introduction and growth phases of the product life cycle. The most explored model is a 
diffusion model developed by Frank Bass in the 1960s.8 The Bass diffusion model quanti-
fi es the early phases of the product life cycle presented in Exhibit 16-1 for many product 
categories.
The Bass diffusion model is useful in forecasting market growth rates. It has been ap-
plied in a number of industries, including agricultural, industrial, medical, and consumer 
products. Furthermore, its validity has been demonstrated across various cultures.
At its core, the Bass diffusion model for new product categories divides the market into 
two types of customer: innovators and imitators. Innovators will buy after hearing about 
the product based on their own motivation. Imitators will wait for another person with 
direct experience of the product to buy a product prior to purchasing it themselves.
To construct the Bass diffusion model, let us defi ne St as the unit sales and Qt as the 
cumulative units sold at the time period t. Similarly, at the end of the next time period, 
the unit sales will be St11 and the cumulative of units sold will be Qt11. (The defi nition of 
the term “time period” is up to the researcher’s discretion; it can be weeks, months, or 
years, although it is most common to use years as a basis for analysis.) The value of the 
Bass diffusion model is its ability to predict the unit sales during the next time period, 
St11. From this metric, it is also possible to determine the next period’s cumulative sale 
volume within the product category, St11 1 Qt. Moreover, the Bass diffusion model can 
be used to quantify the total volume potential of the market over the entire product 
introduction and growth phases. Let us denote the total volume potential with the vari-
able N. N is a metric of the units that would be sold to saturate the market with one 
unit per customer.
The Bass diffusion model assumes that the volume of sales is the sum of the sales from 
the innovator and imitator customer groups. In its basic form, it also assumes that each 
customer in the market purchases once and only once. The assumptions make the model 
more appropriate for the early stages of a durable goods market than for either frequently 
purchased goods or for mature markets.
The volume of unit sales from the innovator group in the period of t 1 1 is dependent 
upon two factors. The fi rst factor, a, is the coeffi cient of innovation, a parameter that
refl ects the tendency of customers to behave as innovators. The second factor is simply the 
number of people within the market who haven’t yet purchased. Because Qt is the number 
of units that have been sold up until time t 1 1, and N is the total potential number of 
units that can be sold in the market, the size of the market that hasn’t purchased at time
t 1 1 is simply N 2 Qt. Thus, the volume of sales from innovators is given by the product 
of the coeffi cient of innovation and the size of the remaining market: 
Next Period Innovator Sales 5 a ? [N 2 Qt] 
Eq. 16.1
The volume of unit sales from the imitator group in the period of t 1 1 depends upon 
three factors. The fi rst factor is the coeffi cient of imitation, a parameter that refl ects the

tendency of customers to behave as imitators. The second factor is a measure of the poten-
tial of imitators to imitate an existing customer. Under the model assumptions, imitators 
purchase a product only after seeing someone else with it. The probability that they will 
see another customer with the product is related to the ratio of the cumulative number of 
customers within the current market to the total number of potential customers. Because 
Qt is the cumulative number of units sold to date and N is the total potential number of 
units that will be sold, the ratio of the number of customers within the current market to 
the total number of potential customers is Qt yN. The third factor is, again, the number of 
people within the market who haven’t yet purchased, N 2 Qt. Thus, the volume of sales 
from imitators is given by the product of the coeffi cient of imitation, the probability that 
an imitating customer will interact with a customer who has already purchased, and the 
size of the remaining market:
Next Period Imitator Sales 5 b ?  
 Q t  
___ 
N  ? [N 2 Qt] 
Eq. 16.2
The total of sales in the next time period is simply the sum of the sales from innovators 
and imitators. Using Equations 16.1 and 16.2, we can write
 S (t11) 5 a ? [N 2 Qt] 1 b ?  
 Q t  
___ 
N  ? [N 2 Qt] 
Eq. 16.3
Equation 16.3 is extremely powerful. Given just three parameters that describe a specifi c 
new product category, N, a, and b, a marketer can predict the unit sales in any future
period given the cumulative unit sales of past periods. As such, the evolution of a market 
can be predicted with great precision.
The remaining challenge is quantifying these three parameters: N, the total market 
size; a, the coeffi cient of innovation; and b, the coeffi cient of imitation. One technique 
that has gained popularity is to use multivariate regression analysis. With regression 
analysis, the researcher will rearrange Equation 16.3 into an appropriate form and re-
gress the sales volume at time t 1 1 against the cumulative sales at time t and the cumu-
lative sales squared at time t 1 1. In doing so, the research will rely only on data that 
refl ect the units sold during prior periods within the product category to identify the 
required parameters and therefore predict the sales at any future time period. Bass diffu-
sion model parameters generated from multivariate regression analysis for an assortment 
of  industries can be found in Exhibit 16-2.

t would be foolish to wait until you have invested great effort and time developing a 
pricing strategy and only then ask whether the path you laid out is legal. Even though 
the rules are sometimes murky, assessing legal risks needs to inform the entire process 
of developing pricing strategy. The ultimate conclusion sometimes requires more detailed 
analysis than you can provide yourself. Your immediate goal should be to recognize the clear 
legal boundaries so that you can identify areas where you need to seek help early on as you 
develop your pricing strategy. With that in mind, this chapter provides a simple overview of 
U.S. federal antitrust law and identifi es some constraints that it imposes on pricing decisions.1

Pricing Decisions and the Law by Dennis P. W. Johnson
Over many years now, federal antitrust enforcement has become more business-
friendly. Nonetheless, familiarity with the antitrust laws remains essential because criminal 
violations can result in real jail time, signifi cant fi nancial penalties, or both. Federal
antitrust statutes authorize both criminal prosecutions by the U.S. Department of Justice 
and civil suits initiated by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to 
enjoin unlawful behavior. Criminal fi nes are steep—computed with a maximum limit of 
twice the amount of gain or loss—but prosecutions are reserved for the most egregious 
violations, typically price-fi xing schemes among competitors. Although government civil
suits may seem less of a concern, they are just as costly because they require extensive
investigations. Perhaps most importantly, though, federal antitrust laws encourage private 
enforcement by rewarding successful plaintiffs with their attorneys’ fees—at defendants’ 
expense—and further penalizing defendants by awarding treble (triple) damages in many
cases. It’s a one-way street: prevailing defendants cannot make the losing plaintiff
reimburse them for their fees. That said, the good news is that so-called private plaintiffs 
nonetheless face an uphill struggle.
The goal of this chapter is to give you a working framework for asking whether a
particular pricing scheme is likely to be challenged. Unfortunately, there are very few clear-
cut rules in the law of pricing, and a court’s inquiry is likely to be fact-intensive. Thus, 
this chapter fi rst provides a basic overview of the goals and aims of federal antitrust laws 
regarding pricing to help you better understand how courts evaluate challenged pricing 
schemes. This chapter then discusses several types of pricing behavior that the law has 
recognized, explaining what has generally been deemed permissible and impermissible.
The Aims of the Law of Pricing
It is important to understand both what the antitrust laws seek to police and what they 
do not. The general goal of U.S. antitrust law is to promote competition, not to protect
competitors. The law therefore targets pricing behavior that deprives consumers of the 
benefi ts of competition. This is the conceptual starting point for any court evaluating a 
pricing scheme. Although it is too soon to know how future administrations may change 
federal antitrust enforcement, the current administration’s policy statements promise a 
renewed focus not only on enhancing competition but also preventing exclusionary or 
predatory conduct that may harm competition and ultimately consumers.2
Price fi xing is the historical core of U.S. antitrust laws. Begin with a classic price-fi xing 
case: Two competitors selling the same grade of gasoline from adjoining stations agree 
that they both will charge the same price. They have agreed to stop competing, with the 
result that they have “restrained competition.” To judge the impact of this agreement upon 
competition, courts began with a straightforward assumption: By its very nature, the effect 
of an agreement to no longer compete must be to lessen competition. Drivers who need 
to fi ll their tanks in that neighborhood no longer can enjoy the lower prices that are the 
fruits of competition. This assumption became the so-called “per se standard” that courts 
applied to analyze most types of price fi xing. Although courts gave lip service to the notion 
that only “unreasonable” restraints on competition violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 
the U.S. Supreme Court long ago decided that an agreement to charge the same price must 
fall in that prohibited category. Classic cases of price fi xing, such as bid rigging, still apply 
this conclusive presumption, as do cases involving market allocations, by which one com-
petitor agrees not to sell a common product in the same territory served by his competitor. 
The two competitors may not offer any analysis of the actual effect that their agreement 
has upon competition or claim that it is justifi ed by its special purpose. 
It has taken decades of slow economic enlightenment to expand the exceptions to this 
presumption, which now largely have swallowed the “per se” rule. Those exceptions instead 
are judged by examining their actual effect on competition through the “rule of reason,”

which weighs all the circumstances in a detailed inquiry into the market impact of the
restraint. When the rule of reason applies, the defendant company is permitted to
demonstrate that its challenged pricing practice actually enhances competition rather than 
restrains it.
Over decades of evolving antitrust analysis, most types of pricing practices now fall into 
one of these two categories: per se or rule of reason. Some types of cases noted here have 
been moved from the per se category to the rule of reason. Finally, the line between the 
two categories is not always readily apparent. This has given rise to categories of cases that 
require courts to begin with only a “quick look” using the rule of reason before inferring 
anticompetitive effect, because it seems at least intuitively obvious.
For at least the past three decades, the rule of reason has been the starting point for 
antitrust analysis. Even cases that at fi rst glance involve price fi xing now receive a more 
careful examination under the rule of reason. Although old-fashioned, simple price fi xing 
remains per se illegal, courts now analyze far more types of pricing systems under the rule 
of reason. As a result, what is prohibited by U.S. antitrust laws today depends in large 
measure upon the impact that the particular scheme has upon competition. 
Unlawful Pricing Behavior
Broadly speaking, the law recognizes four categories of anticompetitive (and therefore 
prohibited) pricing behavior: (1) price fi xing, (2) non-price vertical restraints, (3) exclu-
sionary and predatory pricing, and (4) price and promotional discrimination. Each will be 
discussed in turn in the next sections. 
PRICE FIXING 
Price fi xing may be horizontal (by competitors selling to common customers) or vertical 
(by fi rms in the same chain of distribution). Manufacturers of competing products that 
both sell to distributors (horizontal competitors) may not agree to set or maintain the 
price or terms of sale of common products. This is the clearest single example of conduct 
that will land you in jail. 
Vertical price fi xing (“resale price maintenance”) involves an agreement between a 
manufacturer and its distributors to sell at a stated price. Unlike horizontal price fi xing, 
these vertical pricing agreements are not illegal per se, as described later in this chapter. 
The fi rst conclusion is that despite the language of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, not every 
“contract, combination, or conspiracy” is one considered “in restraint of trade” without 
further analysis. Courts decide which agreements restrain trade rather than promote it by 
applying the rule of reason and determining that the economic impact of the particular 
agreement contributes more to competition than it takes away. 
Horizontal Price Fixing and Other Agreements
Competitors cannot agree upon prices. However, Section 1 has never prohibited unilateral 
decisions to fi x prices. You can refuse to sell to anyone who declines to pay your price. But 
Distributor A cannot agree with Distributor B (its competitor) on the price at which both 
will sell to Retailer C. Nor can they agree that neither will sell to Retailer C. Although not 
formally “price” fi xing, other non-price agreements among competitors to boycott suppliers 
or to refuse to deal with particular customers are likewise illegal per se. The same is true 
of agreements not to compete in certain geographic areas. 
Agreements can be proved in several ways. Courts do not require a written
contract between competitors (“direct” evidence) to demonstrate a collective agreement. 
Price-fi xing conspiracies, like any other type of conspiracy, can be proved by a mosaic of
indirect (“circumstantial”) evidence without an explicit agreement. Courts even may

infer an agreement where entities are imitating their competitors—known as “conscious
parallelism”—if additional factors are present. These additional factors may include
circumstances where the pricing behavior would be against an entity’s self-interest if acting 
alone, but benefi cial if acting in concert and where the given entities had been in communi-
cation or otherwise had the opportunity to agree (“collude”). One competitor’s conscious 
following of another’s price alone is insuffi cient to demonstrate a conspiracy. 
The law is relatively straightforward: Competitors cannot agree to fi x prices. When 
courts pronounce these schemes per se illegal, what they mean is that the agreement
without anything more violates the law; no effect has to be demonstrated. Bookseller A 
cannot call up Bookseller B down the street and set the price that both will charge for 
the same book. Both are free to charge the publisher’s list price; but they cannot, for 
example, agree to discount the publisher’s list price to a specifi c amount, or by a specifi c 
percent. This includes agreements, like those described previously, that can be proven only 
indirectly. In addition, per se illegal agreements are not limited to agreements between 
competitors to fi x prices; they also include agreements to fi x terms affecting price, such as 
warranties, discount programs, fi nancing rates, and production quotas.
Vertical Price Fixing
The law as it pertains to vertical price fi xing, including resale price maintenance, is more 
nuanced. Courts test the legality of agreements to fi x prices within the supply chain under 
the rule of reason by, as described previously, balancing the anticompetitive effects of 
a given scheme against its pro-competitive effects. Vertical agreements to set maximum 
resale prices (“ceiling” prices) have been tested under the rule of reason for more than 
a decade; yet agreements between manufacturers and dealers to set minimum prices 
(“fl oor prices”) were subject to the per se rule until 2007. The latter agreements usually 
are addressing discounting. By allowing manufacturers to reward dealers for providing
point-of-sale services (for example, knowledgeable salespersons, showrooms, and higher 
inventories), these agreements enhance interbrand competition by eliminating the
advantages that free-riding competitive retailers otherwise enjoy. Remember, however, 
that the rule of reason is a balancing test—the positive effects on interbrand competition 
resulting from agreements to set resale prices must, and will, be balanced against any
negative effects on competition that the agreements might also engender. 
Manufacturers also may unilaterally set either maximum or minimum resale prices by 
announcing their policies and refusing to sell to any reseller that will not comply, so long as 
there is no agreement between the parties. Resellers may lawfully adopt similar policies as 
well. Unilateral resale pricing policies, in which compliance is truly voluntary, are legal and 
are not even tested for anticompetitive effects under the rule of reason.
However, any and all suggestion of agreement must be avoided, and the law can 
prove tricky in this respect. Not only must obvious forms of agreement, like contracts, 
be avoided, but behavior that is less intuitively indicative of agreement must be avoided 
as well. For example, suppliers wisely simply choose to cease selling to a noncompliant 
reseller without warnings, threats, or probationary periods because those techniques
suggest that the supplier has coerced an agreement with the reseller. In other words, the 
policy must be implemented on a “take it or leave it” basis. Conversely, resellers should 
avoid any communication that may be taken as an assurance that they have agreed to 
comply with the supplier’s demand. 
Genuine consignment, agency, and brokerage arrangements allow suppliers to dictate 
resale prices unilaterally because they retain title. Supplier and reseller alike must maintain 
a bona fi de consignment to prevent the arrangement from being perceived as per se vertical 
price fi xing. Courts examine whether the reseller has assumed the risk of loss and other indicia 
of ownership of the product, the supplier’s purpose in adopting these systems, as well as 
whether the reseller willingly entered into the arrangement rather than being coerced into it.

Manufacturers may provide suggested resale prices to dealers in writing or through 
advertising to the dealers’ customers can even provide preticketed resale prices on the 
product. In these instances, the dealers must decide independently whether to follow 
them but also must remain free to reject them. The manufacturer may encourage dealers, 
but some arrangements will require a jury to decide whether the supplier crossed the 
line between persuasion and coercion. Thus, risk-averse manufacturers may choose less-
aggressive approaches. Tactics that the reseller’s competitor views as coercive but do not 
yield some sign that the reseller assented are not signs of agreement. A manufacturer in 
theory may even terminate a dealer in response to complaints that the dealer has not 
observed “suggested” resale prices, but lawsuits that require trial to decide whether 
the manufacturer’s action was truly unilateral rather than the product of its agreement 
with other complaining dealers are high prices to pay and result in long periods of
uncertainty. An illegal agreement between manufacturer and distributor to maintain 
resale prices requires proof that the manufacturer sought the distributor’s acquiescence
or agreement and that the dealer somehow communicated its assurances in response, even 
if by a lesser means than an explicit agreement. 
Resale Price Encouragement
These techniques are also called vertical non-price restraints. Rather than directly dictating 
particular resale prices to their dealers, suppliers can induce their adherence to a desired 
resale scheme through various incentives. Such incentive schemes are judged under the rule 
of reason. 
These incentives often take the form of advertising allowances. For example, many 
suppliers use Minimum Advertising Price (MAP) programs. Under a MAP program, a 
retailer must agree to a supplier-determined lowest price at which the supplier’s product 
may be advertised to receive advertising allowances from the supplier. 
Similarly, a manufacturer may:
• Provide rebates directly to its dealer’s customers or even reimburse dealers who 
paid it to their customers, if the dealer remains free to set its own price
• Provide promotional allowances to reduce wholesale prices, if the dealer remains 
free to determine whether to reduce its resale price
• Offer dealer assistance programs that require the dealer to pass a manufacturer’s 
price reduction down to the dealer’s customers, if the dealer continues to set its 
own prices
• Use cooperative advertising programs that deny reimbursement to dealers who 
failed to conform to the manufacturer’s directions to include its suggested retail 
price or no price at all
• Agree with one dealer that the prices that the manufacturer charges will be no 
higher than those that it charges to other similarly situated dealers 
• Use voluntary national account pricing among its dealers, so long as independent 
dealers remain free to solicit those accounts outside the national account program
However, manufacturers may not impose a price maintenance scheme together with 
territorial or customer restrictions because the latter restrictions are per se illegal. 
NON-PRICE VERTICAL RESTRAINTS
Manufacturers also may use various non-price restraints on dealers to control the
marketing of their products and combat against discounting and dealer free-riding. These 
include the customer or territorial restrictions or product restrictions discussed later in 
this chapter, which are evaluated under the rule of reason applied under Section 1 of the

Sherman Act. Courts uphold such a restraint if its pro-competitive effect on interbrand 
competition outweighs its anticompetitive effect on intrabrand competition. In addition, 
when the seller imposing such restraints enjoys substantial market share, plaintiffs may
challenge the restraint under a second antitrust law—Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful for a company to “monopolize, or attempt 
to monopolize,” trade or commerce. 
Customer and Territorial Restrictions
Sellers may mandate that dealers sell their product only to certain customers or only 
within certain geographic territories. Courts will uphold these arrangements if the
pro-competitive effect on interbrand competition outweighs the anticompetitive effect on 
intrabrand competition. These arrangements are rarely invalidated, so long as they are 
purely vertical. Different standards apply than those relating to vertical price restrictions, 
although the practical effect of both price and non-price restrictions is similar.
The risk of running afoul of the law arises when a seller enjoys a substantial market 
share. The greater the market share, the greater the potential for an anticompetitive effect 
from customer or territorial restrictions. Such sellers are advised to consider methods to 
control marketing short of outright restrictions. For example, a seller might consider imple-
menting a “primary area of responsibility” arrangement, wherein its dealers are permitted to 
sell outside their primary area but must exercise their best efforts to increase sales within it. 
Quotas can be implemented to give these programs teeth. Another arrangement that sellers 
may use is known as the “profi t passover” in which sellers permit dealers to sell outside 
their designated primary territory but require that they split revenue with the dealers in 
those other territories. These are both effective ways to minimize discounting that stems 
from free-riding on the marketing efforts of other dealers. 
Product Restrictions
Refusals to Supply. Generally speaking, suppliers may refuse to sell to whomever they choose—
manufacturers or customers—so long as the decision is not part of a horizontal agreement 
with competitors or part of a strategy to acquire or maintain a monopoly. Thus, for example, 
a supplier may lawfully agree to sell only to a particular dealer within a given territory. 
Exclusive Dealing Agreements. Manufacturer-imposed product restrictions on dealers
are also typically upheld. Manufacturers use “exclusive dealing contracts” to prevent 
retailers from purchasing a certain type of product from other manufacturers. Courts 
widely recognize that these agreements have the pro-competitive effect of creating
dedicated dealers that actively promote the seller’s product. For example, they provide 
attractive stores, well-trained salespersons, long business hours, sizable inventory, and 
warranty plans. These agreements also simultaneously prevent discounters or online
sellers from free-riding off those dealers. Courts generally uphold these agreements
when they result in retailers providing extra services to customers. The legality of an 
exclusive dealing agreement is most likely to be questionable—as is true for most non-
price vertical restraints—where manufacturers enjoy large market share. For example, 
courts are not likely to uphold an exclusive dealing contract by a powerful manufac-
turer that results in competing manufacturers being denied access to enough retailers 
to sustain a viable amount of sales. Such manufacturers are advised to implement less 
legally risky methods of creating dedicated dealers, such as requiring dealers to purchase 
minimum quantities of their product.
EXCLUSIONARY OR PREDATORY PRICING
Other pricing arrangements involve various means of using a manufacturer’s market 
power to either force additional sales or drive competitors out of the market.

Tying
In a tying arrangement, the seller conditions the sale of one product (the tying product) on 
the simultaneous purchase of a second, usually less-desirable product (the tied product). 
Several different antitrust statutes apply to these arrangements, and services, franchises, 
and trademarks can also serve as the tying “product.” Older cases treated tying arrange-
ments as per se illegal, but the test that courts now apply to most arrangements closely 
resembles the rule of reason. The seller must have suffi cient market power with respect 
to the tying product to restrain free competition in the market for the tied product, and 
must use it to coerce the sale of the tied product. The tying arrangement must affect a “not 
insubstantial” amount of commerce. The seller must have enough power to force the pur-
chaser to do something that he or she would not do in a competitive market, but it does 
not need to have monopoly power. Even a seller with a patented product is not assumed 
to have market power. In addition, just what dollar amount of commerce constitutes a 
“not insubstantial” amount is determined on a case-by-case basis. Cases in which the seller 
demands an exclusive dealing relationship with the buyer or forces its full line of products 
on the buyer apply similar analyses.
Predatory or Below-Cost Pricing 
Predatory pricing is one means by which a seller may use its monopoly power unilaterally 
to preserve or attempt to gain a monopoly. Both are violations of Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act that require defi nition of the “relevant” market in terms of the products and geographic
boundaries. A seller that already has monopoly power may not maintain it through
anticompetitive conduct, as distinguished from robust competition. The line is not clearly 
drawn, and courts attach conclusory labels to distinguish “exclusionary conduct” from 
mere “vigorous competition” by examining whether the seller intentionally acts without 
other business justifi cation to exclude competitors from the market, with the likely effect 
that monopoly power is maintained, enhanced, or acquired. 
Pricing below the seller’s cost of production for the purpose of eliminating competitors 
in the short run is prohibited. However, courts explicitly recognize that price cutting to 
increase business is classic competition; what distinguishes predatory pricing is the seller’s 
dangerous probability of being able to recoup its short-term losses by long-term profi ts 
after it has driven a competitor out of its market. This requires pricing below marginal cost 
or average variable cost, after fi rst determining which costs are incremental rather than 
fi xed. The analysis is further complicated by the need to replace accounting labels with 
principles of economics. The federal courts of appeals have applied various and sometimes 
confl icting analyses of these issues. In addition to defi ning what the predatory act is, courts 
struggle to measure its scope and duration, the predator’s fi nancial ability to endure short-
term losses and the whether the market is one that will sustain monopoly pricing after the 
victim has been driven out. These cases often involve claims that what the seller defends
as promotional or temporary discounts are in fact maintained for suffi ciently longer periods 
of time to become predatory, but no fi rm tests of these principles exist. Price squeezes 
invoke power that the predator has in one product that is an input or component and it 
sells at a supra-competitive price in one market while charging an unjustifi ed lower price 
for the fi nished product in a second market. Under current cases, the defendant seller must 
have either monopoly power or a dangerous probability of it in the downstream market 
in which the plaintiff competes. 
PRICE AND PROMOTIONAL DISCRIMINATION 
When Congress fi rst passed legislation directed at price discrimination, World War I had 
not yet begun. In 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act amended Congress’s fi rst effort, but 
it left businesses with a counterintuitive, if not outright competitively harmful, law that

requires some patience to traverse. Congress has never fi xed this statute. The good news is 
that only some of the practices prohibited by this Act may be criminally prosecuted, and 
that has not happened in about the last fi fty years.3 In fact, the Department of Justice has 
essentially left enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission, and its enforcement activity 
has been minimal. Plaintiffs also have a lower likelihood of succeeding with these claims, 
but that is no guarantee that you will not be sued and exposed to the high cost and serious 
distraction of a competitor’s or customer’s suit. Thus, you must still understand and com-
ply with the civil prohibitions that your customers or competitors may try to use against 
your promotional and other pricing activities.
The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits:
• Sellers from discriminating between different buyers when it adversely affects 
competition, unless the sellers are matching a competitor’s price (“meeting 
competition”)
• Buyers from knowingly inducing or receiving such a discriminatory price
• Sellers from granting and/or buyers from receiving certain commissions or 
brokerage fees except for services actually rendered
• Sellers from providing or paying for promotion or advertising in a product’s resale 
unless they offer equivalent terms to all competing buyers
Some basic coverage issues often lead to the failure of those few private suits attempted 
under this law. Discrimination of course requires more than one sale. Any prohibited sales 
must result in injury to competition (meaning the process of competition, not just lost 
sales to a single competitor). Competition is assessed based on what “level” is involved:
competition among sellers is labeled “primary line” competition; competition at the buyer’s 
level is “secondary line” competition. In some cases, the distinction between the two levels 
determines whether the pricing action violates the Act. Both sales compared and chal-
lenged must be made in interstate commerce—at least one of the sales involved must pass 
from one state to another. The connection to interstate commerce for Robinson-Patman 
cases is applied more narrowly than in price-fi xing cases. 
Price discrimination requires that a single seller sell two products to two purchasers at 
different prices. Services are not commodities. The items must be of “like grade and quality” 
based upon characteristics of the product itself rather than brand names and labels, packaging, 
or warranties. Physical differences in products place them outside this test. 
The price difference must cause competitive injury, another thoroughly litigated concept. 
The injury may more than a reasonable possibility or a probability. It either (a) may substan-
tially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or (b) injure competition with anyone 
who grants or knowingly receives the benefi t or with customers of either of them. As has 
been the case with other antitrust concepts, the competitive injury requirement has shifted 
to a more objective predatory pricing standard. Whereas older cases focused more upon the 
seller’s intent, since a 1993 case, the Supreme Court has rejected a purely subjective intent 
test and replaced it with the cost-based test that is applied to predatory pricing cases under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act (that also prohibits predatory pricing). There is still plenty of 
room for disagreement and litigation: to perform this test, the Supreme Court only required 
use of “an appropriate measure” of the seller’s costs.4
As noted previously, injury to competition may be measured not only at the seller’s 
own level (primary line), but also at the buyer’s level (secondary line). The latter requires 
competition between favored and disfavored purchasers, who must compete in the same 
geographic market. You might reasonably expect that to prove injury to competitors, a 
plaintiff would need to prove that it lost sales; but often the inference of injury is enough. 
It may rest on a substantial price difference over a substantial period of time on a product 
that is resold by sellers involved in “keen” competition. A challenged company may defend

its pricing scheme by rebutting this inference of injury to competition via showing that the 
very customers who might be inferred to have suffered declines in sales and profi ts instead 
have prospered. 
As if these undefi ned tests were not already hard enough to apply, the Supreme Court 
has required plaintiffs who bring such lawsuits to begin them with allegations that go
beyond accurately stating the required legal conclusions put in terms of correct labels; they
must allege suffi cient facts at the outset to at least suggest they will be able to prove the 
required elements. However, even though it is unlikely that your company will be sued for 
violating this statute and lose, the uncertainty of these tests make it diffi cult to decide for 
yourself whether a price that you want to charge is legal. In addition, the different federal 
circuits do not all agree on how to decide key issues like those previously discussed. Thus, 
even if you asked a lawyer to assess the legality of your prices, the answer may come out 
differently in different geographic areas of the country simply because different courts 
apply different standards. Even beyond this, the Supreme Court has left unresolved basic 
uncertainties such as whether the injury to be proved must be an actual injury, rather than 
the inferred injury that has been suffi cient historically. 
International Antitrust Enforcement
In addition to enforcing U.S. antitrust laws against fi rms whose conduct has domestic 
competitive impact, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division currently emphasizes 
the importance of consistent enforcement of common antitrust prohibitions, so that fi rms
operating in the global economy will be evaluated under consistent standards.5 This
requires a level of coordination with other countries’ laws that prohibit anticompetitive 
actions similar to those prohibited under U.S. law. For example, in the European Union (EU),
Article 81 of the Treaty of the European Communities (the European Community’s compe-
tition law) prohibits cartels and vertical agreements that restrain competition within the 
common market. The statute also prohibits price fi xing and market sharing, but it exempts 
collusion that promotes distributional or technological innovation if the restraints are 
not unreasonable (“disproportionate”) and do not risk eliminating competition. Article 82
prohibits dominant fi rms from abusing their position by price discrimination and
exclusive dealing, similar to U.S. antitrust laws. EU law prohibits mergers that might
signifi cantly impede effective competition, similar to U.S. law. Canada and Japan have 
similar provisions. 
Intel Rebates Case Exercise
On July 28, 2007, the European Commission (EC), an antitrust authority, accused Intel Corp. 
of abusing its market dominance over rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in the chip
market. After conducting an investigation, the European Commission leveled a € 1.06 billion
fi ne against Intel on May 13, 2009. Intel felt it had followed the law and believed the claims 
against it were false. As such, Intel chose to appeal to the European Court of First Instance.
Read the following reference articles concerning Intel and the European Commission’s
investigation (listed under item 10) and address the following questions:
 1. What were the allegations against Intel regarding its rebate program?
 2. What were the positive commercial purposes of Intel’s rebate program in terms of 
generating sales for Intel?
 3. What were the positive and negative commercial aspects of Intel’s rebate program 
for its customers?
 4. What were the negative commercial aspects of Intel’s rebate program for its 
competitor, AMD?

 5. Was Intel’s rebate program an abnormal practice for industrial fi rms?
 6. In light of your research and analysis, what advice would you provide a CEO of 
an industrial fi rm regarding rebate programs specifi cally, and price structures that 
cannot be matched by competitors in general? 
 7. When should a fi rm use a legal price structure that cannot be matched by 
competitors, and when might it avoid such a price structure even if it was 
anticipated to improve profi ts?
 8. Discussion Question: How would you analyze whether to run different programs 
in the United States as opposed to areas governed by EC standards?
 9. Discussion Question: To make the decision for the U.S. market, would you need to 
answer the same questions given previously? Explain why or why not, and if not, 
what questions would you want to answer?

Notes
1 State antitrust laws typically mirror the federal ones discussed here. Differences among states can be 
signifi cant, and you should assume that any product sold in the United States is subject to one or more 
state laws. International antitrust laws are beyond the scope of this chapter. Articles contained in the 
Treaty of the European Communities are comparable to the Sherman Act prohibitions of price fi xing 
and other “concerted” activity among competitors and monopolization (the EC terms are “abuse . . . of 
a dominant position within the common market”). However, the results reached by the EC in specifi c 
cases—for example, applying these provisions to rebates and imposing stiff fi nes on Intel in May 2009 
for rebates in exchange for future exclusive purchases—may be more harsh than U.S. rulings on the same 
facts would be.

“This is an exceptional resource for anyone interested in mindfulness 
and college student mental health. The book offers very accessible sum-
maries of a variety of mindfulness-based treatment approaches, as well 
as practical applications to clinical practice, grounded in empirical 
research. I plan on sharing the book with staff at our counseling service 
and finding ways to implement many aspects of it into my daily clinical 
work with students. It is an important addition to the mindfulness-based 
literature.”
—Gregory T. Eells, PhD, director of counseling and 
psychological services at Cornell University and past 
president of the Association for University and College 
Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD)
“Pistorello and her colleagues have created an incredible and timely 
resource for anyone treating the fully wired and constantly connected 
Generation Z college student. This easy-to-read book effortlessly guides 
the reader through practical, evidence-based applications of dialectical 
behavioral therapy (DBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and mindfulness-based 
cognitive therapy (MBCT) designed specifically for college students 
receiving treatment at college counseling centers. Judicious use of case 
vignettes and transcripts brings concepts to life. Whether you are new 
to mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies or they are deep in your 
bones, this creative and well-written book will positively influence your 
clinical practice with this high-risk population.”
—Linda A. Dimeff, PhD, author of Brief Alcohol Screening and 
Intervention for College Students and DBT in Clinical Practice
“This book should quickly become a treasured resource on college cam-
puses. It is a practical and accessible presentation of best practices based 
on mindfulness and acceptance. A timely and valuable contribution to 
improving the mental health and wellbeing of college students!”
—Daniel Eisenberg, PhD, associate professor at the University 
of Michigan School of Public Health and principal 
investigator of the Healthy Minds Study, a national survey 
study of college student mental health

The  
Mindfulness & Acceptance  
Practica Series
As mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies gain 
momentum in the field of mental health, it is increas-
ingly important for professionals to understand the full 
range of their applications. To keep up with the growing 
demand for authoritative resources on these treatments, 
The Mindfulness and Acceptance Practica Series was 
created. These edited books cover a range of evidence-
based treatments, such as acceptance and commitment 
therapy (ACT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 
compassion-focused therapy (CFT), dialectical behav-
ioral therapy (DBT), and mindfulness-based stress re-
duction (MBSR) therapy. Incorporating new research in 
the field of psychology, these books are powerful tools for 
mental health clinicians, researchers, advanced students, 
and anyone interested in the growth of mindfulness and 
acceptance strategies.

Acknowledgments
T
he editor would like to thank a number of individuals who have 
contributed to this book, starting with the chapter authors. For 
some of the authors, writing a chapter was a novel experience 
and required taking time out of a busy clinical schedule to write a para-
graph at a time. For others, writing a “how-to” book, instead of an empir-
ical piece, posed its own challenges. Editing a book was a new experience 
for me as well, and I thank all the authors for their psychological flexibil-
ity! One of the pleasant surprises in this journey was the incredible 
opportunity I had to interact with a thoughtful, perspicacious, and caring 
group of individuals whose interests overlap so much with my own. 
There is another group of authors I’d like to acknowledge: those not 
included in this book. It is a testament to the relevance of these processes 
to college students that, since first organizing this book, I have learned 
of a number of additional initiatives underway to implement mindfulness 
and acceptance on college campuses. The present volume is not meant 
to be a comprehensive description of every effort under way, but rather a 
description of some key initiatives that hopefully will inspire readers to 
continue their work with students using new methods, or, conversely, 
continue their work with mindfulness and acceptance but now with 
college students.
I think I speak for all the authors when I say that we are extremely 
grateful to the college students we have known, have treated, taught, 
supervised, or otherwise interacted with, in our respective careers. This 
is an exciting population to work with, and their courage, strength, and

wish to “give back” to other students continue to astound me. Their 
willingness to try out the different approaches discussed here made this 
book possible. 
This book would not have happened without the support of New 
Harbinger visionaries, including Matt McKay and Catharine Meyers, 
and of a cadre of highly capable, thoughtful, and caring professionals 
who made sure this book was the best that it could be. Thanks also go to 
Spondita Goswami, my research assistant, for her tireless help double-
checking references!
I am grateful to my husband, Steven Hayes, for his support, encour-
agement, and patience—it means a lot to me that you always act as if I 
can do anything, even when my passengers say otherwise. Thanks also to 
my son, Stevie Pistorello-Hayes, for reminding me every day of what 
matters most in life. 
I would like to dedicate this book to my amazing nieces and nephews 
(Fernanda, Gisele, Marquinho, Alexsandro, Daiane, Vanessa, Melissa, 
Gesiane, Diane, Clarissa, e Amanda) for allowing me to bear witness to 
the wonders of growing up and for showing me how much vitality a sense 
of humor, strong community, and perseverance can bring to the young 
adult years (and beyond). Every single one of you has taught me some-
thing important and meaningful for my work with college students: 
obrigada.

here has been a proliferation of a variety of mindfulness-­ and 
acceptance-­based approaches throughout college campuses. 
The field has gone from finding mindfulness “exotic” to seeing it 
almost as mainstream. This book brings together several of these differ-
ent innovative initiatives into one single volume, so that readers will be 
able to quickly get a glimpse of the type of mindfulness- and acceptance-­
based programs currently being applied in higher education settings.
The Chapters
The book has twelve chapters. Chapter 1 discusses the unique context in 
higher education and society in general that lends itself to mindfulness- 
and acceptance-based interventions. Chapter 2 presents the application 
of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) to college stu-
dents, both as a comprehensive approach, now empirically validated with 
this population, and as skills training only as an adjunctive form of treat-
ment. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the theory and model behind 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & 
Wilson, 2011), which is a topic in many of the chapters in this book. 
Chapter 4 focuses specifically on the use of ACT groups with college 
students presenting with different types of concerns. Chapter 5 juxta-
poses two different approaches: Mindfulness-­Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002) and ACT as applied in a

college counseling center; results from a controlled study are presented. 
Chapter 6 provides a detailed outline of an 8-­week group utilized with 
college students based on Mindfulness-­Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; 
Kabat-­Zinn, 1990). Chapter 7 specifically addresses perfectionism in 
college students, utilizing ACT. Whereas chapters 2-­7 outline approaches 
utilized within college counseling centers buildings, Chapters 8-­9 focus 
on technological innovations such as downloadable podcasts (Chapter 8) 
and online values training (Chapter 9). Chapters 10-­12 address other 
aspects of campus life: Chapter 10 illustrates the utility of mindfulness 
and acceptance in informing peer mentoring, Chapter 11 describes four 
adaptations of ACT into classroom settings, and Chapter 12 describes 
how Ellen Langer’s concepts of mindful learning (1997) can be applied to 
programs in Student Affairs, such as leadership training.
This book describes mindfulness-­ and acceptance-­based initiatives 
not only from across the U.S., but also across other parts of the world 
(See Chapters 5, 8, and 10).
Chapters’ Structure
Each chapter follows a particular structure:
1.	 It will start out with clinical vignettes to illustrate which student 
presentations may benefit from the approach discussed in the 
chapter.
2.	 It includes a “how to” section, with a description of at least a 
couple of exercises or applications of the technology described in 
that chapter. This may include fictional therapy transcripts to 
give the reader a feel for the intervention.
3.	 It includes an Empirical Considerations section that will summa-
rize the state of empirical knowledge on the technology described 
in the chapter (i.e., DBT), as well as any data collected by the 
authors on their specific program (i.e., DBT with college stu-
dents). This section is meant to help the reader surmise the gist 
of the evidence in an easily digestible format.

4.	 It will include a Final Words section to highlight a few issues or 
challenges in using the chapter technology with college students 
and/or higher education settings.

Who Can Use This Book
This sub-­section will outline for whom this book is intended and how it 
can be used.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
4
Counselors at College Counseling Centers 
or Student Health Centers
This book is indeed primarily intended for mental health profession-
als (psychologists, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists) working at 
college counseling centers and/or student health centers, regardless of 
levels of expertise with these approaches:
• If you are already familiar with some of the methods described in 
the book (e.g., ACT, DBT, mindfulness), but not in the context 
of higher education, this book can guide you on how to use that 
approach with college students and/or college campuses 
specifically.
• If you are already applying these methods in your work with 
college students, some of the handouts/materials in the Appendix 
can provide you with options to further innovate with relatively 
little effort, as you may edit the handouts or presentations, for 
example, to your own needs/setting.
• If you are not yet familiar with these methods, this book will 
provide you an overview of mindfulness and acceptance methods 
applied to college students. The book will give you enough infor-
mation on a particular approach to allow you to decide whether 
or not you want to learn more.
• If you are medical staff working with students in a student health 
center regularly, these approaches may also be of help, even 
when delivered via relatively brief interactions with students. 
Some of these approaches have been successfully used in primary 
care settings.
Instructors or Professors
If you are an instructor or professor, the following uses might apply:
• If you are someone who is familiar with mindfulness, for example, 
some of these chapters will give you ideas on how to infuse these 

================================================================================
How to Use This Book
5
concepts and technologies into educational contexts, including 
the classroom. Chapter 11 in particular will present four differ-
ent ways to present ACT in a classroom setting. Other chapters 
may also be relevant, such as Chapter 12 that describes a version 
of mindfulness particularly geared towards learning.
• If you are routinely faced with students in your class who are 
distressed or distressing, or who write about psychological strug-
gles, this book will help you become better informed. These 
chapters will describe some of the cutting-edge counseling 
approaches that are being utilized with college students. This 
may help you in understanding students in your class and possi-
bly making more effective referrals.
Other Student Affairs Personnel
If you are a professional working in Student Affairs/Services, this 
book could be helpful in many ways:
• If you are someone who regularly teaches First Year Seminars 
(FYS), several chapters may help you generate useful ideas on 
how to make such seminars more experiential in nature and less 
didactic. In Chapter 11, for example, there is a description of an 
FYS based on mindfulness and acceptance.
• If you are someone doing trainings in peer mentoring or leader-
ship training, and would like to incorporate concepts and/or 
techniques from mindfulness and acceptance-­based approaches, 
this book can help you. Chapter 10 describes a peer mentoring 
system infused with ACT and related concepts that is being 
applied in dozens of campuses nationwide. Chapter 12 describes 
a mindfulness-­based approach to leadership training.
• If you work in other Student Affairs offices, mindfulness-­based 
approaches may still be of help. Student Affairs personnel are 
the front line in dealing directly with students about a range of 
sensitive topics (e.g., financial aid, parking, disabilities resource 
centers, judicial affairs, residence hall behavior). This book may 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
6
provide you with ideas for how to use mindfulness and accep-
tance within yourself in interacting with distress and distressing 
students, or with the students themselves.
Other Readers
University administrators, parents of college students, or college stu-
dents themselves, may find this book informative.
• If you are a university administrator, you may find sections of 
this book enlightening. It may help you obtain an overview of 
the breadth and effectiveness of mindfulness and acceptance-­
based approaches with college students and/or campuses, and 
allow you to make informed decisions about when/how/whether 
to implement mindfulness-­based approaches on your campus.
• If you are a parent (or guardian) to a college student, and are 
interested in learning about how mindfulness and acceptance 
can be, or have been, applied to college students, this book may 
be handy. Although no one chapter is directly addressed to 
parents, your improved knowledge about these methods may 
help you advocate for your child if/when she is in need.
• Finally, if you are a college student either in distress or hoping to 
help a friend in distress, this book may help you learn about 
cutting edge approaches being utilized at counseling centers.
Limitations of This Book
• This book is not meant as a comprehensive description of any 
one approach. It has enough of a “how to” element to give the 
novice reader a flavor of a particular approach in practice. 
However, it cannot substitute for careful training, or at least 
more detailed reading, on any given approach. References will be 
provided at the end of each chapter for the original work on 
each approach.

================================================================================

• This book is not meant as a self-help book. Although readers 
may derive some personal benefit from some of the chapters, 
there are several self-help books that would be better suited for 
actually working on oneself. See Appendix 1A: Self-Help Books, 
for a list of these titles.
In conclusion, although this book is most directly relevant to mental 
health professionals, professors, other student affairs staff, medical per-
sonnel working at student health centers, parents, and even college stu-
dents themselves, may find the book useful.

eorge dashes across campus, late for his economics class, after 
stopping for a “decaf, skinny, vanilla, venti latte, with cinna-
mon on top”—­said with machine-gun precision—­at Starbucks. 
Holding his cell phone to his right ear with his hunched-up right shoul-
der, he talks to his bank about a mix-­up while checking for his iPad 
charger in his backpack. Whew, it’s there, otherwise he wouldn’t be able 
to Skype his family later. He wants to find out if everything is OK back 
home, given the TV scenes he has witnessed of the latest devastation in 
the Midwest. The images of houses reduced to a pile of boards, a few 
bricks, and debris, make him wonder if all his high school classmates are 
OK. These images don’t last long, as he next starts making a mental note 
to check all of his e-­mail accounts—­why can’t his parents and professors 
just text like everybody else? As he approaches the building where his 
class is taught, his heart rate jumps and a wave of hot sensations course 
through his body as he sees his ex-­girlfriend heading toward the class 
they had originally signed up for together—­now hand in hand with her 
new boyfriend, whose photo he’s seen already on Facebook. George 
thinks they haven’t seen him; he turns around and heads back to the

dorm. He can always get the notes from someone else later and he does 
feel a touch of a cold, after all.
Many adults look back to their college years and remember them as 
relatively carefree—a time before full adult responsibilities needed to be 
carried out. If psychological help was relevant, it was for things like 
picking a major, or learning to manage time, or just getting along with a 
roommate. George, the student described above, as a representative of 
the college student of today, may beg to differ.
The Problem
If that myth of the carefree college years was ever actually true, it appears 
to be true no longer. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among 
college students (Suicide Prevention Resource Center, 2004). Nearly 
20% of college students have seriously considered suicide and over 7% 
have attempted it in their lifetime (American College Health Association 
[ACHA], 2011). Non-­suicidal self-­injury (NSSI) has been found to have 
15.3% lifetime and 6.8% past-year prevalence rates among college stu-
dents (Whitlock et al., 2011). Nearly 50% of college students have a diag-
nosable psychiatric disorder (Blanco et al., 2008); nearly one-fifth have 
suffered from depression and two-thirds experienced overwhelming 
anxiety in their lifetime (ACHA, 2011). Severe drinking problems are 
common, with over 45% engaging in binge drinking (Wechsler & 
Kowalik, 2005) and 20% experiencing an alcohol use disorder (Blanco et 
al., 2008); 600,000 college students are injured and 1,800 die each year 
from alcohol-­related accidents (Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009). 
Approximately 14% of undergraduate females and 4% of undergraduate 
males receive a positive screen for a current eating disorder (Eisenberg, 
Nicklett, Roeder, & Kirz, 2011). The list could go on, and not only in this 
country. Several of the chapters in this book describe similar trends in 
countries around the world, such as Australia, Italy, and the United 
Kingdom (see chapters 5, 8, and 11).
Part of the reason for such horrid statistics is that college is a time of 
transition, and transitions are not easy. People become full adults in the 
college years. These are the years that young adults learn to individuate 
from parents, to establish social relations, to settle into their sexuality, to 
decide how they will deal with drugs and alcohol, and to rise to financial,

intellectual, and social demands (Kadison & DiGeronimo, 2004). 
Students are adjusting to newfound freedom, with more control over 
their schedules, selection of activities, choice of friends, food consump-
tion, and myriad similar choices large and small. At the same time, there 
is often a loss of family contact, and exposure to religious, racial, sexual, 
or cultural differences that may be disconcerting. For some large groups, 
such as international students, these stressors can be almost overwhelm-
ing (Matsumoto et al., 2001; Muto, Hayes, & Jeffcoat, 2011). Failures in 
adjustment and mental health problems that occur during this time can 
have long-­lasting consequences (Eisenberg, Golberstein, & Hunt, 2009; 
Seeley et al., 2011; Zivin, Eisenberg, Gollust, & Golberstein, 2009).
The Opportunity
Bleak statistics like this are a challenge, but they also represent an oppor-
tunity. College is a pivot point. The mental health problems that emerge 
during this time of transition may last for years (Zivin et al., 2009) or 
even a lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Fortunately, the reverse is also true. 
Skills obtained, and problems prevented or ameliorated, can also last for 
years or a lifetime. And that realization leads to another exciting one: 
Higher education is designed to create life-­changing experiences.
An infrastructure exists on campuses to educate and mold human 
beings. In a sense, colleges are all about providing potentially life-­
changing interventions. That is true not only of college counseling 
centers, but also of student orientation and success programs, health 
centers and wellness programs, or college classes, clubs, talks, and inter-
net sites. College is about learning, and learning how to live a vital, com-
mitted human life is in a deep sense the whole purpose of psychological 
intervention. Furthermore, college is often intensely social, in a way that 
life later may not be. That allows the use of social processes to produce 
change that might not be as possible just a few years later. Not only that, 
but in the Western world a large portion of the adult population touches 
higher education and the proportion is still rising. In the United States, 
41% of the adult population will spend at least some time in college 
(Snyder & Dillow, 2011).
This helps frame what is exciting about the present volume. The 
college years are critical to healthy development. College students are a

wonderfully rich population with real psychological needs, not just help 
in picking careers or learning to study. The college setting offers special 
opportunities for change that could make a real difference to important 
behavioral domains of a large portion of the entire population over time. 
Psychologically speaking, college students matter.
The Challenge
It is one thing to see an opportunity. It is another to be able to seize it. 
Colleges and universities are overwhelmed, and no area of college more 
so than college counseling centers. The severity of clinical problems on 
campus appears to be on the rise (Twenge et al., 2010), along with the 
demand for counseling services (Gallagher, 2011). This is occurring at 
the same time that colleges and universities are strained as institutions 
and are being asked to do more with less.
Resources or no resources, however, colleges cannot walk away from 
these problems even if they wanted to do so. The public relations and 
legal effects of mental health problems have taught campuses that they 
have no choice but to expand their mental health efforts since the public 
and the courts will not let them off the hook if they try to shift these 
responsibilities elsewhere. A sad but telling example exists in mass kill-
ings and suicides. For example, in the spring of 2007, a single under-
graduate student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 
in Blacksburg, Virginia, killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before 
committing suicide. Investigations questioned the roles of the college 
counseling center and the campus police, among other entities. In the 
years since, Virginia Tech has paid millions upon millions of dollars to 
victims, and the drip-­by-­drip succession of awards continues with no 
clear end in sight. For example, in spring 2012 yet another award for $4 
million was granted to two more families (CNN, March 14, 2012). The 
incident is hardly unique. In 2011 Yale University was accused of negli-
gence in a lawsuit by the family of a graduate student murdered in a 
school laboratory five days before she was to be married (McMullen, 
2011). In July of 2012, a student withdrawing from the University of 
Colorado allegedly killed twelve people at a movie theater, and the role 
of the psychiatrist who had been treating the student on campus was put 
under a magnifying glass by the media. Any college administrator looking 

================================================================================

13
at such situations realizes that in the modern day it risks the entire insti-
tution, not just the health of students in need, to pretend that campus 
mental health efforts do not matter.
Unfortunately, it is not enough just to have a well-­staffed counseling 
center because treatment seeking can be low among college students 
(Hunt & Eisenberg, 2010). For example, in the United States, only 34% 
of those with a mood disorder and 16% of those with an anxiety disorder 
seek treatment in a given year (Blanco et al., 2008). Students report not 
seeking services partly because they lack time, want to try to handle 
these issues on their own, or are not convinced of the seriousness of their 
problems (Eisenberg et al., 2011).
The Context
All of this can explain why efforts to improve the mental health of stu-
dents are important, but it does not yet explain why the acceptance, 
mindfulness, and values work such as that described in this volume is 
particularly important. There are at least five reasons to think that it is.
The Practical Benefits of a 
Transdiagnostic, Common Core 
Process Approach
The very diversity of problems faced by college students as they tran-
sition into full adulthood is stunning. When combined with the extent 
of need, it is hard to imagine how institutions can successfully mount 
programs that will make a real difference across the board. There are 
existing efficacious prevention programs that can be used on campus, for 
example, in areas such as eating disorders (Stice, Shaw, & Marti, 2006), 
harmful alcohol use (Carey et al., 2007), and depression and anxiety 
disorders (Christensen et al., 2010). Many of these programs are under-
utilized, however. If a college has a program in harmful alcohol use, for 
example, the cost and complexity of adding another for suicidality, 
another for eating disorders, and yet another for anxiety and so on, just 
becomes overwhelming. Even if a campus took that approach, students 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
14
generally are not jumping at the chance to participate in programs at all, 
never mind several. What the work on acceptance and mindfulness 
offers is the possibility of a transdiagnostic common core process 
approach that can develop resilience skills that are applicable to the pre-
vention of a wide range of problems and difficulties, and at the same time 
ameliorate a wide range of current problems.
While the days are still early, that possibility seems real. An example 
is a study by Muto et al. (2011) that applied a self-­help program in 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & 
Wilson, 2011) to more than half of the Japanese international students at 
a Western university campus. This student group was recruited simply 
because of their international status, not their level of distress. In that 
context, the number of clinical problems was stunning: 80% exceeding 
clinical cutoffs on one or more measures of anxiety, depression, stress, or 
general mental health. Very few had sought treatment for these difficul-
ties, nor were they likely to, given that Japanese international students in 
the United States see psychological difficulties as being more shameful 
and stigmatizing than do either Caucasian students or non-­Asian ethnic 
minority students (Masuda, Hayes, Twohig, Lillis, Fletcher, & Gloster, 
2009). What was important in this context is that in a randomized com-
parison, the program reduced depression, anxiety, and stress relative to a 
waitlist for those in the clinical range, with generally large between-
group effect sizes; and at the same time the program significantly reduced 
the emergence of mental health problems over time for those who were 
not initially distressed with a medium effect size. Mediation analysis 
showed that these effects came due to changes in acceptance and mind-
fulness processes. Thus, focusing on acceptance and mindfulness a single 
program both prevented and ameliorated multiple problem areas. That 
kind of practicality is part of the hope offered by work in this area due to 
the transdiagnostic and common core processes nature of these methods.
The Scalability and Flexibility of 
Acceptance and Mindfulness Work
College students are important not just because these years are a 
time of transition—the importance of transition is equally true of those 
in the same age range who do not go to college (Kessler at al., 2005). 

================================================================================
Mindfulness and Acceptance in College Students: Why it Matters
15
What is exciting in part is that the college setting presents so many dif-
ferent ways of reaching people. College students generally have access to 
counseling, but they also take classes, join clubs, use the Internet, listen 
to podcasts, and so on. Work in acceptance and mindfulness has proven 
to be extremely flexible in format. It can be done individually or in 
groups; in classes or in therapy; over the Internet or in person; via peer 
support or professional intervention. A glance at the table of contents of 
this book shows that readers will be exposed to that sense of scalability 
and flexibility. It is one of the most exciting aspects of this work—maybe 
really useful skills can be acquired through multiple channels if a 
common set of sensibilities infuses a campus.
The Benefits to Staff
A third reason to think that acceptance and mindfulness work fits 
especially well into the college campus setting is that these programs can 
be of benefit to staff themselves. This can be true of deliberate programs 
such as classes in Mindfulness-­Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-­
Zinn, 1990), which is frequently used for staff as well as students on 
campus, or through employee assistance programs. It is true in a broader 
way as well. As mindfulness, acceptance, and values enter into schools 
and organizations, they bring benefits for students and staff alike, perhaps 
because they soften and humanize the interactions between people 
(Biglan & Hinds, 2009; Meiklejohn et al., 2012; Noone & Hastings, 
2010).
Some of the rise of acceptance and mindfulness may be a cohort 
effect linked to staff. The children of the 1960s and ’70s were exposed to 
Eastern methods as a result of the popularity of authors such as Allan 
Watts or D. T. Suzuki, or the popularity of the Beatles and their interest 
in the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. To express this idea in a slightly silly way: 
the hippies grew up and now they are driving the bus. Fortunately, work 
in acceptance and mindfulness is arriving as part of evidence-­based 
practice, which allows excesses to be trimmed back and what is useful to 
survive. There is something useful to teachers and providers inside this 
work that seems to prevent burnout and enhance the mental health and 
sense of personal accomplishment of professionals and clients alike. 
These effects have been shown with psychotherapy providers (Brinkborg, 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
16
Michanek, Hesser, & Berglund, 2011; Hayes et al., 2004), as well as with 
teachers (Bethay, Wilson, Schnetzer, & Nassar, in press; Biglan et al., in 
press).
Cultural Changes: Mindfulness is 
Especially Needed Now
The final reason to think that acceptance and mindfulness work is 
particularly relevant to the campus now is that the world has changed. 
The world has become far, far more verbal.
As illustrated by the opening vignette in this chapter, the college 
student of today grew up with computers, the internet, e-­mail, text mes-
sages, cell phones, MP3 players, and a raft of similar technologies. They 
are the first connected generation, but they were connected not just to 
each other but also to pain, horror, and judgment as a daily diet. George, 
the student described in our opening vignette, not only kept in contact 
with family and friends in a supportive sense, but also got to witness 
through simultaneous broadcast the devastation of his neighbors’ houses 
in the Midwest and witness in a painfully public way his being replaced 
by a new boyfriend due to Facebook.
If anything terrible happens anywhere in the world, we can know 
about it minutes later. We can watch tsunamis live—­seeing the walls of 
water swallow cars, homes, and people before our very eyes. If a bomb 
goes off or a rocket falls, we can see the video as people are killed. If a 
person is beaten by police, a local bystander will upload the iPhone video 
to YouTube.
This is not all to the bad. Technology is creating a sense of commu-
nity and common action. A dictator was overthrown in Egypt in part 
because it is difficult to control social media (Naughton, 2011). Students 
arrive at college being part of a social network, and with the ability to 
access information and to multitask. But it is also increasing exposure to 
judgment, criticism, shame, and blame. A quick visit to any news portal 
on the Internet will show the phenomenon. After a news story, readers 
are allowed to post comments. Inevitably, these comments will be filled 
with hateful criticism and judgments, often not just of the story but also 
of other people making comments. Students may be on the receiving end 

================================================================================
Mindfulness and Acceptance in College Students: Why it Matters
17
of such things, with over a quarter of college students saying they have 
been the victims of cyberbullying (Held, 2011). Students have committed 
suicide after college roommates have posted secret recordings of them 
and other students have been put in jail for doing so (Zernike, 2012). 
There is a harsh edge to being part of the connected generation.
The cacophony of horror, pain, and judgment is overwhelming stu-
dents’ ability to find peace and purpose. The human mind did not evolve 
for such a situation. Language evolved in a cooperative context, but its 
usefulness as a problem solving tool has so fed prediction, categorization, 
and judgment that people are beginning to think of life itself as a problem 
to be solved rather than a process to be lived (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 
2011).
This book will present various approaches to mindfulness, accep-
tance, and values clarification drawn largely from Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011), but also from 
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), Mindfulness-­Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-­Zinn, 1990), Mindfulness-­Based 
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002), and 
Mindful Learning (Langer, 1997). While the exact approaches differ, all 
of these methods emphasize at least three key targets: learning to be 
more psychologically open and flexible, to be more centered in con-
sciousness and in the now, and to be more actively engaged in meaning-
ful, values-­based action (Hayes, Villatte, Levin, & Hildebrandt, 2011).
Being more open, aware, and active is an antidote to the cultural 
changes that are making peace of mind more difficult. The early and 
frequent exposure to pain and judgment has encouraged more avoidant 
and entangled approaches to psychological experiences. Openness and 
flexibility help tamp down these excesses. The rise of judgment and 
problem solving has caused people to drift away from the present moment 
and to become more focused on maintaining their story about them-
selves. Being centered in consciousness and in the now helps bring peo-
ple’s feet back to the ground. As people have been drawn into an 
unhealthy self-­focus, they have put life on hold, or have responded impul-
sively rather than in ways that create a sense of purpose and direction. 
Being actively engaged in living out one’s values allows consciousness to 
be linked to purpose. For most of us, that is the bottom line of most 
importance.

Connecting Deep Human Concerns 
with Evidence
Finally, it is not just that acceptance, mindfulness, and values fit the 
practical and cultural need; it is also that this work has become vigor-
ously evidence-­based. In the modern era, nothing less will do. 
Administrators, clinic directors, professors, staff, and students them-
selves rightfully expect to see the data showing that methods are useful. 
We have learned that these methods are effective, not just at the level of 
overall outcome, but also at the level of their components and putatively 
important change processes (Hayes, Villate, et al., 2011). In fact, this 
field, even within the context of working specifically with college stu-
dents, has just in the last few years become so prolific that the chapters 
in this book represent only a fraction of the work being conducted on 
campuses. In the Thomson Reuters portal Web of Science, if one enters 
“college students” crossed with just a few key terms such as mindfulness, 
meditation, psychological flexibility, personal values, and experiential 
avoidance, over 100 studies have been published in the last decade (com-
pared to almost none in the decade before), already garnering over 1,000 
citations in the literature, despite their recent appearance (see Figure 1).
Final Words
The problems, opportunities, challenges, and larger context of college 
have led to a moment in which acceptance, mindfulness, and values are 
arriving on campus. It seems very unlikely that these trends will reverse 
anytime soon. The fit is too useful, the need is too great, and the data are 
too supportive. This book is the first to focus exclusively on this exciting 
frontier. It will walk the reader through the developments that are 
increasingly taking college campuses by storm. If we embrace and guide 
these developments, they have a chance to make a profound difference 
in the lives of millions.

of her roommates saw a red substance on the bathtub and soon realized 
it was blood. She discussed this with two of the other roommates and the 
three of them confronted Amy, who acknowledged that she had indeed 
cut her wrists but “chickened out.” The roommates also noted that Amy 
hardly ever eats, is already very thin, and sometimes goes on drinking 
binges. Surprisingly, she usually seems “together” (well groomed, with 
makeup), although the roommates noted that they walk on eggshells 
around her because she is quick to anger. Amy refused to go to the ER, 
stating that the cut was just a scratch. She did agree to go to the univer-
sity health center, where medical staff also referred her for counseling. 
She had been reluctant to go, but the Resident Director (RD) said that 
unless she attended counseling, she could not remain in the residence 
halls. Amy then attended an assessment at the counseling center accom-
panied by her RD. Amy’s story illustrates an increasingly common situa-
tion in college counseling centers (CCCs) these days: students present-
ing for treatment with multiple complex problems, whose psychological 
struggles have ripple effects on the entire university community and who 
may or may not be doing well academically and may or may not seek 
treatment.
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the use of Dialectical 
Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993a, 1993b) with college students 
presenting with severe, complex profiles, such as Amy. The chapter will 
begin with a review of trends among college students that support the 
need for DBT in CCCs, along with a description of comprehensive DBT. 
We will then illustrate the potential application of DBT at a CCC 
through two different projects: 1) Project 1 is the first randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) showing the effectiveness of comprehensive DBT, 
relative to an optimized control condition, with college students; 2) 
Project 2 describes the clinical experience of offering DBT skills training 
alone as an adjunctive treatment at a CCC. The chapter will end with a 
discussion of empirical considerations and challenges/recommendations 
in applying DBT, either in its comprehensive format or as a skills-­group 
only approach, to college students.

Why We Need DBT at College 
Counseling Centers
CCCs across the nation are treating students with increasingly higher 
levels of psychopathology, such as suicidality, non-­suicidal self-­injury 
(NSSI), personality disorders (particularly borderline personality disor-
der [BPD]), and complex issues (e.g., Kitzrow, 2003). Data collected from 
a survey of CCC directors (Gallagher, 2011) paints a picture of increased 
severity, complexity, and acuity. Approximately 90% of counseling center 
directors noted an increase in overall psychopathology, but the greatest 
stress on the resources of CCCs appears to come from an increase in the 
number of extremely distressed students presenting with complex pro-
files: 78% of directors noted an increase in crises requiring immediate 
attention and a threefold increase in number of hospitalizations since the 
mid-­1990s (Gallagher, 2011). Furthermore, directors estimate that 37% 
of students seeking services have severe psychological problems, 6% with 
problems that are so severe that they cannot remain in school and 31% 
with problems that can be managed while still in school (Gallagher, 
2011). Most directors reported that their jobs are more stressful than they 
used to be, partly because of the pressure to manage students with 
increasing complexity (73%) and to prevent tragic events from occurring 
on campuses (51%; Gallagher, 2011).
Even when data are not collected by retrospective self-­report, this 
pattern prevails: the percentage of students presenting with depression, 
suicidality, and personality disorders appears to have at least doubled 
within a decade (Benton, Robertson, Tseng, Newton, & Benton, 2003). 
Recent data collected from students seeking services tells a similar story. 
A survey from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH, 2012) 
found that approximately 32% of students presenting to treatment at 
counseling centers nationwide are experiencing some level of suicidal 
ideation, 30% have taken a psychotropic medication, and 7.1% have been 
previously hospitalized for psychiatric reasons.
The definition of “severe or complex” cases presenting to counseling 
centers often includes borderline personality disorder (BPD) features or 
correlates (e.g., Lippincott, 2007). These features include: suicidality and 
self-­injury, dissociative or psychotic symptoms, uncontrolled anger, 
intense relationships, comorbid eating disorders, comorbid substance

abuse, trauma, dysfunctional family of origin issues, difficulty forging a 
working therapeutic alliance, prior hospitalizations, and a history of 
treatment failures (e.g., Gilbert, 1992).
Although staff report that there are increasing numbers of students 
presenting with BPD or significant BPD features to CCCs (e.g., Tryon, 
DeVito, Halligan, Kane, & Shea, 1998), the prevalence rate of BPD 
among treatment-­seeking college students is unknown. The absence of 
clear prevalence rates may be due to several factors: many counseling 
centers do not typically diagnose (e.g., Kitzrow, 2003), some of the cases 
may be at a “subclinical” level (Tryon, DeVito, Halligan, Kane, & Shea, 
1998), and due to “apparent competence” (Linehan, 1993a), these stu-
dents may initially present with a more functional profile than they 
maintain in general. Although some CCCs quickly refer such cases to 
off-campus providers, BPD is regularly treated on campuses (Tryon, 
DeVito, Halligan, Kane, & Shea, 1998). Leaving these individuals 
untreated may result in “disruptive or disturbing behavior, potentially 
affecting numerous people on the college campus, including roommates, 
classmates, faculty, and staff” (Kitzrow, 2003, p. 287).
Clearly the severity and complexity of cases presenting for treatment 
at CCCs is increasing, and DBT is one of the few empirically validated 
approaches that can treat severe multi-­problem presentations including 
suicidality, non-­suicidal self-­injury, and BPD features.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): 
A Brief Overview
Developed by Marsha Linehan and colleagues (Linehan, 1993a, 1993b), 
DBT is designed to treat problems associated with emotion dysregulation 
and is supported by dozens of controlled studies (see Empirical 
Considerations section below). DBT is built around a biosocial or trans-
actional model for the development of BPD and other disorders of 
emotion dysregulation (Fruzzetti, Shenk, & Hoffman, 2005; Linehan, 
1993a). The key transaction is between an emotionally vulnerable indi-
vidual and social invalidation in his or her family and environment, 
which mutually affect each other. Vulnerability to becoming dysregu-
lated includes sensitivity and high reactivity to emotional stimuli in a 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
27
person’s social environment, as well as a slow return to emotional base-
line. Invalidating responses from others convey that the person’s private 
experiences (emotions, desires, opinions, etc.) are illegitimate, wrong, or 
incomprehensible. In this ongoing transaction, a person’s vulnerabilities 
make her more susceptible to being invalidated, and being invalidated 
increases her vulnerabilities, ultimately leading to chronic emotion dys-
regulation (Fruzzetti & Worrall, 2010).
Treatment targets in DBT are arranged hierarchically, by stages of 
disorder (Linehan, 1993a). Stage One refers to severe problems that 
sometimes include out-of-control overt behaviors, such as severe suicidal-
ity, self-­harm, severe substance use, inability to attend or participate 
effectively in treatment, being too depressed to go to school or work, 
binge-­eating or purging, and so on. Within Stage One, targets are 
arranged hierarchically as well, with life-­threatening behaviors at the top 
of the hierarchy, followed by behaviors that interfere with treatment, 
then behaviors that severely interfere with quality of life (severe depres-
sion, eating disorders, substance use, etc.). In Stage Two, the focus moves 
to misery and severe emotional suffering, but in the context of some 
control over action. Here, a person may be able to engage in the struc-
ture of her life (e.g., go to school, stay safe) but still has moderate to 
severe clinical problems such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Stages 
Three and Four are less clinical, focusing on problems in living and a 
mindful capacity for happiness and close relationships, respectively.
Comprehensive DBT differs from traditional psychotherapy inter-
ventions in a variety of ways. First, outpatient DBT is a comprehensive 
program of treatment that includes five different functions (Linehan, 
1993a): 1) psychological skill training, typically in groups, to help clients 
learn specific psychological skills; 2) individual therapy, to address client 
motivation (targeting, doing chain analyses of problems, developing and 
pushing for solutions, and providing support and validation); 3) planning 
and coaching to help clients generalize their new skills to difficult situa-
tions in their lives; 4) a therapist consultation team meeting to help 
therapists improve their treatment skills and maintain motivation to 
treat effectively; and 5) couple, parent, family, or other social interven-
tions to help people in the social environment support the client’s 
progress.
DBT therapists teach clients, usually in a group format, the following 
skills to help them master tasks related to emotion modulation 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
28
and self-­management (Linehan, 1993b): 1) mindfulness (to facilitate 
attention control, reduce judgments toward self and others, and to build 
self-­awareness and self-­management skills); 2) interpersonal effectiveness 
(to help reduce chaos and invalidation and help build social support); 3) 
emotion regulation (to reduce emotional vulnerability, reactivity and 
misery, and to facilitate emotion modulation and self-­management); and 
4) distress tolerance (to interrupt negative emotion escalation and urges 
to engage in out-­of-­control behavior and to “accept” things in life that 
are very undesirable but unchangeable).
In addition, DBT employs a dialectical epistemology across all 
aspects of the treatment. In practice, this means utilizing principles of 
both acceptance (understanding, validating) and change (behavior 
therapy and problem solving) in the treatment (Linehan, 1993a). It also 
means that every dimension of the treatment can be conceptualized 
within a dialectical framework. For example, the therapist communi-
cates dialectically with the client, using both a warm, supportive, genuine 
communication style and an unorthodox, pushy, matter-­of-­fact or irrever-
ent communication style. Similarly, the therapist typically consults with 
the client on how to solve his or her problems, but sometimes intervenes 
directly to solve them. In terms of solutions, both more acceptance-­
oriented solutions (mindfulness, distress tolerance, accepting emotions 
and situations) are developed and more traditional change-oriented solu-
tions (changing the situation, others, or, in some situations, emotions) 
are implemented.

Comprehensive DBT (Linehan, 1993a, 1993b) has been utilized as part 
of a federally funded randomized controlled study in a mid-­size Western 
university. The results of this study are reported in detail elsewhere (See 
Pistorello, Fruzzetti, MacLane, Gallop, & Iverson, 2012) and summarized 
briefly below, but first we will describe some of the modifications and 
adaptations of comprehensive DBT utilized in this study. We have found 
certain modifications of DBT helpful when applying it to college 
students.
Skills Training Modifications
In terms of changes in skills training, we added a 3-­week module in 
validation skills training utilized in other studies (e.g., Iverson, Shenk, & 
Fruzzetti, 2009) and shortened the distress tolerance module to three 
weeks. Linehan enumerates six levels of validation, starting with listen-
ing skills and evolving into increasingly more sophisticated and hypo-
thetically more powerful levels of validation (Linehan, 1998). The vali-
dation skills taught as part of this study were gleaned from two modules 
of validation: self-­validation (Fruzzetti, 2011) and relational validation 
(Fruzzetti, 2009). Self-­validation pertains to “taking yourself seriously, 
allowing yourself to feel what you feel (primary emotions), think what 
you think, want what you want, with acceptance and without judgments, 
second-­guessing, self-­loathing, or self-­contempt” (Fruzzetti, 2011, p. 3). 
The areas taught included: understanding what self-­validation is, outlin-
ing the steps in self-­validation, and sustaining self-­validation in the 
context of invalidation by others. Relational validation (Fruzzetti, 2009) 
included skills in relational mindfulness and accurate expression as nec-
essary precursors to relational validation, as well as specific steps in being 
able to validate others. A key concept imparted is that “in order to be 
understood, or for another person to respond in the way you want, you 
first must be able to identify accurately what you want (or feel, think, 
etc.) and tell the other person in a way he or she can understand” 
(Fruzzetti, 2009, p.7).
In order to add validation, we also shortened some of the other skills 
from DBT (Linehan, 1993b). During our pilot work, college students who 
had participated in DBT skills training groups reported finding parts of 
the distress tolerance module less helpful to them than skills in the area 

================================================================================

30
of emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness, and somewhat 
repetitive (e.g., soothing with five senses mostly overlapping with mind-
fulness skills). This feedback stands in contrast of work with adolescents, 
where distress tolerance was rated highly (Miller et al., 2000). This dif-
ference between adolescents and young adults in college could simply 
reflect idiosyncratic factors of these samples (e.g., how the skills were 
taught or the composition of the group), or could possibly be because 
students who are able to remain in college may have already mastered 
some of the distress tolerance skills in the module, given that the distress 
tolerance module was originally designed for a severe community sample 
(Linehan, 1993b).
Thus, in our study, there were three DBT skills areas (emotion regu-
lation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance/validation), 
each lasting six weeks and immediately preceded by two weeks of mind-
fulness training, for a total of three modules, lasting eight weeks each. 
Additionally, skills training was adjusted to students’ schedules. We 
shortened the length of skills groups to 1.5 hours a week instead of 2.5 
hours (Linehan, 1993b) in order to better accommodate students’ busy 
class schedules. One of the challenges in running any group on a college 
campus is finding a time that everyone can attend. We also only con-
ducted one group per semester, starting a few weeks into the semester, 
when everyone’s class schedules were finalized and ending before finals, 
as students often miss group sessions during finals. Therefore, in an aca-
demic year, the three eight-­week skills modules followed the campus 
schedule with one module taught in the spring, one in the fall, and one 
in the summer.
DBT Attendance Requirements and 
Therapeutic Contact Modifications
The campus setting necessitated a few other modifications to DBT, 
including attendance issues. As is typical of DBT, CCC counselors 
relentlessly encouraged attendance and followed up on missed sessions 
through phone calls, e-­mails, and texting. Because students generally left 
town for extended periods of time, participants had to miss at least four 
scheduled consecutive individual appointments without making contact 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
31
with the therapist to be considered to have dropped out of therapy, even 
if they were away for three months.
The definition of therapy attendance was broadened. For example, 
students often leave campus or town during holiday closures. With this 
knowledge, we reduced the chance that students would miss appoint-
ments by offering sessions conducted via phone or Skype during school 
vacations. College students often use text messaging and e-­mail, in addi-
tion to phone, to communicate. Thus, traditional coaching methods 
(Linehan, 1993a) were modified to accommodate the student’s preferred 
method of communication. While it is preferable to assess lethality in 
person, the phone, texts, and e-­mails can serve as an effective tool for 
skills coaching.
Finally, comprehensive DBT was originally empirically validated to 
last one year (Linehan, 1993a), although studies have used different 
treatment dosages as well with great success (e.g., Koons et al., 2001). For 
the purposes of the study, we emulated the original empirical studies by 
offering one year of comprehensive DBT treatment to college students 
who needed it. However, we also recognized that not all students pre-
senting with BPD features, suicidality, and complex behaviors would 
require as much treatment, given that college students presenting with 
BPD features differ from community samples (Trull, 1995). Yet, we 
wanted students to have the opportunity to complete at least one skills 
group, and to be seen after a semester break, therefore we required atten-
dance of at least seven months, but treatment could last as long as 12 
months.
Additional DBT Strategies: Some 
Considerations
Traditional-­age college students (18-­22) are a unique population, in 
that they are no longer children, but many are still being financially sup-
ported by, and during the breaks living with, their parents. Comprehensive 
DBT with college students does not automatically involve parents the 
way DBT with adolescents might (Miller, Rathus, & Linehan, 2006). 
However, parents remain a very important aspect of college students’ 
lives. A recent study showed that 30% of all college students speak to at 
least one of their parents every day, that when distraught, they often 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
32
prefer to speak to their parents, and that not having a parent as a confi-
dant was a key factor in predicting students who progressed from NSSI 
into suicidal ideation (Whitlock, in preparation). Thus, as needed, we 
relied on family interventions during the DBT treatment, utilizing avail-
able DBT protocols (Fruzzetti, Santisteban, & Hoffman, 2007). These 
interventions involved sporadically conducting in-­person and over the 
phone sessions with parents, always in the presence of the student client. 
The purpose of such sessions varied greatly, but often included psycho-
education about the biosocial model, which was often discussed with 
non-­abusive parents as a function of “incompatibility” as opposed to 
invalidation (Hoffman, Fruzzetti, & Swenson, 1999). This nonjudgmen-
tal way of explaining to parents their child’s pattern of escalation can 
help parents develop some perspective taking skills without inviting 
defensiveness (Hoffman, Fruzzetti, & Swenson, 1999). At other times, 
these sessions focused on agreements between student and parents on 
how parents can respond during suicidal crises periods, as a way of reduc-
ing inadvertent reinforcement of escalation.
In DBT, we may irreverently say “I can’t treat you if you are not alive” 
(Linehan, 1993a). In DBT with some college students, we may say “I 
can’t treat you if you are not in school.” Although dropping out of school 
may be the most effective behavior for a student, sometimes, the shame 
and feelings of failure that dropping out of school evokes may offset any 
benefits of leaving a stressful environment. In a way, leaving school for 
some students exhibiting BPD features may function like hospitalizations 
for chronically suicidal individuals: it may provide temporary relief to all 
involved but the problems are likely to persist or even worsen after dis-
charge (Chiles & Strosahl, 1995). Many students may face additional 
challenges, as well as a sense of lack of direction, upon dropping out of 
school—­not to mention the fact that the underlying suicidality, depres-
sion, or whatever else was going on back in college will still be present. 
Conversely, sometimes dropping out of school temporarily may provide a 
much needed respite for a distressed student. Typical DBT conceptual-
izations are very important in figuring out the function of the behavior of 
dropping out of school. In our study, we made concerted efforts to keep 
students enrolled if the student so wanted when in “wise mind” (Linehan, 
1993b). For example, Amy, the student discussed at the beginning of the 
chapter, feared going back to Japan and being faced with a lot of criticism 
and ostracism by her family for “wasting so much money” if she returned 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
33
without a terminal degree. Her family had always been a trigger for her 
suicide attempts and coming to the U.S. to study had been her “last 
resort.” Her suicidality, as it turns out, had been triggered by her not 
doing well in a couple of classes and fearing having to drop out of school 
and return home. In this instance, we worked with Amy to request 
special dispensation to take fewer credits and remain enrolled (interna-
tional students have to remain full-­time at most schools).
The above situation with Amy also illustrates a more direct impact 
on the environment by the therapist than a typical “consultation to the 
patient” approach in DBT (Linehan, 1993a). Similar to DBT in general, 
the preference is always to coach the student to initiate interactions with 
the university instead of relying on therapist-­initiated contacts. In this 
context, however, the CCC counselor actually does have the power to 
effect some changes in the environment that the student does not have 
on her own. A letter from a counselor may help students be able to drop 
a class after the drop out date, reduce their credit load and stay enrolled, 
and so on. During our study, we wrote many letters to the university on 
behalf of the students; however, this had to be done carefully, making 
sure that the focus was always on the function of the behavior. For 
example, in Amy’s case, helping her stay enrolled and eventually gradu-
ating helped her build a life worth living. However, situations that seem 
to be functioning as avoidance or “emotion-mind” choices, the DBT 
therapist would be less likely to comply (e.g., allowing a student to break 
an agreement with the residence halls in order to give money to a 
substance-­abusing boyfriend).
Sometimes, DBT therapists may be put in a situation similar to con-
ducting mandated therapy. One of the very first issues to consider is 
“Who is the client?” For example, in Amy’s case, the residence hall con-
tacted the CCC and had a vested interest in her remaining in treatment. 
Students may indeed be kicked out of residence halls after attempting 
suicide. Although commitment strategies from DBT can be useful in 
helping a reluctant student agree to treatment (Linehan, 1993a), it is 
important that these issues be discussed up front with the student and 
the referral source, and that all roles be clarified. In Amy’s situation, for 
example, we agreed that the only information to be shared with the RD 
was confirmation that the student was in therapy.
This study’s results are briefly summarized below under Empirical 
Considerations.

Project 2: Providing DBT Skills 
Training Groups as Adjunctive 
Treatment for College Students
Carrie Guthrie, Holly Landsbaum,  
and Abby Bjornsen
Individuals like Amy are presenting to CCCs across the nation with a 
pattern of hospitalizations, crises, and/or frequent NSSI or suicide 
attempts, and CCCs are actively trying to find an approach that is effec-
tive in clinical impact and costs. The current CCC context is marked by 
a lack of resources and a brief therapy mandate due to high demand for 
services, coupled with a clear need for treatments designed for complex 
presentations (Gallagher, 2011). Despite the lack of clear empirical guide-
lines, CCCs (as well as many other clinical settings) have begun provid-
ing DBT skills training groups alone as adjunctive treatment (Dimeff & 
Koerner, 2007). This is most often due to limited financial resources and 
sometimes the assumption that for many clients, the comprehensive 
DBT package may not be required (Dimeff & Koerner, 2007). In the 
next few paragraphs we will describe one approach to conducting DBT 
skills training as an adjunctive treatment in a CCC.
Development of Skills Group
At the University of California, Berkeley, the CCC is highly utilized 
and largely successful in meeting the needs of the student population. 
However, there are a few sub-­sets of the population, including students 
who present with features or a diagnosis of BPD, who are seeking or are 
in need of more comprehensive, longer-­term services that are not consis-
tent with our brief CCC model. While there are a few DBT resources in 
the community surrounding the CCC, most do not accept the student 
health insurance and are thus financially prohibitive.

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
35
In 2010 we initiated an in-­house task group (TG) to explore the pos-
sibility of providing DBT in the CCC as a way to address the needs of 
students presenting with BPD. The TG ultimately determined that it was 
beyond the CCC scope to provide a comprehensive CBT program and 
recommended that we offer a pilot DBT Skills Group alone (see 
“Appendix 2A: DBT Task Group Recommendations,” at www.newhar 
binger.com/22225). To ensure that skills group members will have ade-
quate treatment, the TG recommended that all participants must be in 
concurrent weekly individual psychotherapy throughout the duration of 
the group. Most students must commit to seeing a therapist off-­campus 
since the group runs beyond the 8-­session limit in the CCC. Although 
the TG had recommended that students see an individual DBT or DBT-­
informed therapist, this was not required due to the limited number of 
DBT therapists available in the community.
Group Selection Criteria
To guide our colleagues in making appropriate referrals, we devel-
oped referral guidelines based on the DBT goals for behaviors to decrease 
(interpersonal chaos, labile emotions, impulsiveness, confusion about 
self, cognitive dysregulation; see “Appendix 2B: Referral Guidelines for 
Managing Emotions Skills Group”). We do not require that students 
meet the full diagnostic criteria for BPD in order to be considered. The 
group screening process focuses on assessing the following: frequency 
and severity of self-­injury/parasuicide and other impulsive behavior; fre-
quency and acuity of suicidal ideation; recent suicide attempt(s) and 
severity; recent hospitalization(s); and co-­occurring issues such as sub-
stance abuse, disordered eating, Axis I diagnoses, and severe interper-
sonal problems. Based on the group leader’s assessment and consultation 
with the student’s other providers, a student who is determined to need 
a higher level of care (e.g. full DBT, partial hospitalization, inpatient hos-
pitalization) will be excluded. Other specific exclusion criteria include 
students who are in current and acute crisis, actively psychotic, medically 
unstable due to an eating disorder or other condition, overtly hostile or 
violent in a group setting, unable to participate in a 1½ hour group or 
complete homework, and unable to commit to group for the semester.

================================================================================

Pre-­Group Meetings
In order to assess for fit and build motivation, every student referred, 
including returning group members, is required to meet with the group 
leaders for a 1-­hour pre-­group screening. We include both group leaders 
in these meetings in an effort to build rapport with the student and to 
establish the co-­leadership structure. During the screening meetings we 
review consent for treatment, provide brief psychoeducation regarding 
DBT, and clearly inform students that we are offering a DBT skills group 
only, not a comprehensive DBT program. We review our Group 
Agreement (see “Appendix 2C: Agreements for Students in Managing 
Emotions (DBT) Skills Group”), which identifies the reduction of life-­
threatening behavior as a primary treatment goal. In addition we explore 
the student’s goals, highlight the attendance policy, specify the require-
ment for concurrent individual therapy, and discuss an explicit safety 
plan that she will commit to with her individual therapist for emergen-
cies. Students are asked to review the entire Group Agreement with their 
individual therapists. We also discuss our collaborative treatment team 
approach and the necessity of consulting with their individual therapists 
and psychiatrists.
Running the Group
Currently we run two 12-­week closed groups each semester. Group 
size has ranged from 7-­11 students. Groups have been led by two senior 
clinicians, one intensively trained in DBT, or a senior clinician and a 
post-­doctoral or post-­Master of Social Work fellow. The groups include 
undergraduate and graduate students. Of the 15 students currently par-
ticipating in the groups, all but two are female. We work directly from 
Linehan’s DBT Skills Training Manual (Linehan, 1993b) but have made 
some adaptations to the structure and time frame due to issues specific 
to working within our academic schedule. A primary goal is to offer all 
of the DBT skills modules over the course of the academic year—­fall and 
spring semesters. We encourage students to participate for at least two 
semesters so that they receive all skills, ideally consecutively. However, 
due to the nature of students’ ever changing schedules, this is not always 
possible. Students are invited to return subsequent semesters to receive 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
37
all of the skills training and to repeat if desired and as space is 
available.
Based on feedback from our initial group members to cover the 
Distress Tolerance Skills early in the group, we decided to offer both 
Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance Skills each semester. Therefore, in 
each group we cover Mindfulness and Distress Tolerance Skills in the 
first 5-­6 weeks, followed by Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills in the fall 
and Emotion Regulation Skills in the spring for the remaining 6-­7 weeks. 
As a result of this schedule we also reduced the length of the Distress 
Tolerance Skills module to 3 weeks (see Project 1 above).
Consultation and Managing Crises
The three group leaders meet weekly for two hours as an informal 
DBT consultation team for group planning and consultation. We rou-
tinely make phone contact with the individual psychotherapist once the 
student has been accepted into the group and again once the group has 
terminated. A large majority of our referrals come from our CCC psy-
chiatrist colleagues, with whom we consult both at the time of referral 
and as questions or concerns arise. Establishing collaborative relation-
ships with the other treatment providers has become a high priority. 
Functioning as a treatment team with weekly phone or in-­person consul-
tation has been essential for our work with some group members, specifi-
cally those who have made suicide attempts, are engaging in potentially 
lethal self-­harm, and for whom significant therapy-­interfering behavior is 
impacting treatment. While our underlying assumption has been that it 
would be ideal for group members to be in concurrent individual DBT 
therapy, we have found that it may be most important for them to work 
with a highly skilled psychotherapist who is motivated to collaborate 
across theoretical orientations and who has the experience and ability to 
maintain a positive working alliance with her client through periods of 
very difficult and high-­risk behavior and interpersonal dynamics.
We have also learned from experience the importance of being 
explicit with group members and their other providers that group leaders 
are unable to provide crisis counseling outside of group time. It seems 
clinically important to maintain these boundaries in terms of limiting 
the amount of time group leaders spend interacting with students and 

================================================================================

other parties outside of group. For a few group members, it appears that 
significant therapeutic progress has been attained across several semes-
ters of their group participation. The cohesive treatment team approach 
with frequent consultation has potentially been a key ingredient in these 
gains. While this perceived progress is encouraging, it remains a contin-
ued area for analysis in regards to the cost to the CCC in terms of the 
amount of time and resources we are investing in a small number of 
students.
Empirical Considerations: DBT with 
College Students
DBT is supported by dozens of controlled trials and other studies 
(See Feigenbaum, 2007 for a review and Kliem, Kröger, & Kosfelder, 
2010 for a recent meta-­analysis). Initial studies focused on treating BPD 
and suicidal and self-­harming behaviors, and more recently DBT has 
been applied successfully to a variety of severe problems including aggres-
sion, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, substance abuse and family and 
relationship problems (cf. Feigenbaum, 2007; Robins & Chapman, 2004). 
Originally developed as an outpatient treatment program, DBT has also 
been shown to be effective in day treatment, residential, inpatient, and 
forensic settings (cf. Feigenbaum, 2007).
Project 1 described above is the first RCT of DBT with college stu-
dents. The sample was composed of a total of 63 college students between 
the ages of 18 and 25 who were suicidal at baseline, reported at least one 
lifetime NSSI act or a suicide attempt, and exhibited significant BPD 
features. Treatment was provided by mental health trainees (i.e., doctoral 
students, postdoctoral fellows, or psychiatry residents), and, emulating 
the approach taken in a recent study where DBT was compared to treat-
ment by experts nominated from the community (Linehan, Comtois et 
al., 2006), supervision was conducted by a locally nominated expert. 
Participants were randomly assigned to either DBT (n = 31) or an opti-
mized Treatment as Usual (O-­TAU) control condition (n = 32). 
Treatment was provided by doctoral or post-­doctoral trainees, supervised 
by experts in both treatments, with the locally nominated O-­TAU super-
visor relying on a non-­cognitive behavioral approach. Both treatments 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
39
lasted between 7 and 12 months and included both individual and group 
components. Assessments were conducted at pretreatment, 3-­months, 
6-­months, 9-­months, 12-­months, and 18-­months (follow-­up).
Analyses revealed that DBT, compared to the control condition, 
showed significantly greater decreases in suicidality, depression, number 
of NSSI events (if a participant had in fact self-­injured), and BPD fea-
tures, and significantly greater improvements in social adjustment and 
global assessment of functioning—­the latter as rated by a blind assessor, 
the therapist, and the supervisor. Most of these treatment effects were 
observed at follow-up. Figure 1 below (reprinted here by permission of 
the American Psychological Association) illustrates some of these find-
ings. Academic performance factors, such as GPA and retention, obtained 
from the university did not show an effect for treatment; however, these 
were difficult to measure. For example, freshmen students did not have a 
baseline value and therefore were discarded from the analyses, and stu-
dents often took classes at, or temporarily transferred to, a local 2-­year 
college, and we did not collect data from other institutions. Interestingly, 
the DBT treatment dropout rate (before seven months of treatment were 
completed) was slightly higher than expected (35%, or 11/31), and higher 
than that reported in other studies (Linehan et al., 2006). However, this 
was not significantly different from that obtained in the O-­TAU group 
(47% or 15/32). Approximately half of the DBT (14/31) and the O-­TAU 
(13/32) groups stayed in treatment for 12 months. The average DBT 
completer attended 34 (SD=10.46) individual and 17 (SD=9.38) skills 
group sessions—­a dosage considerably lower than what would be 
obtained for weekly participation in a 12-­month treatment, as proposed 
in comprehensive DBT (Linehan, 1993a). Yet, the impact of the treat-
ment provided remained quite significant, despite the lower dosage.
Moderation analyses showed that DBT was particularly effective for 
suicidal students who were lower functioning at pretreatment (i.e., Global 
Assessment of Functioning lower than 50). This latter finding is relevant 
to CCCs, as it suggests that a more labor-­intensive approach such as 
comprehensive DBT could be reserved for a smaller percentage of 
“severe” students—­those who are lower in functioning.
The efficacy of DBT group skills training as a stand-­alone or adjunc-
tive intervention in a CCC setting remains to be studied. However, these 
attempts (See Project 2 above) are partly justified, given preliminary 
findings that if carried out competently, DBT skills training alone in 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
40
other settings may be efficacious (e.g., Feldman, Harley, Kerrigan, Jacabo, 
& Fava, 2009; Harley, Baity, Blais, & Jacobo, 2007).
Final Words
Currently there is a clear need for DBT at CCCs. Data from Project 1 
above indicates that comprehensive DBT, even when compared to a 
strong control condition, is effective with college students presenting 
with a complex profile. At this time, this is the only empirically validated 
application of DBT with college students, and thus comprehensive DBT 
is the most indicated treatment option for this population.
Project 1 provided some guidance for reducing costs while applying 
comprehensive DBT. Given our findings that DBT was particularly effec-
tive with lower functioning students, CCCs with limited resources might 
consider offering comprehensive DBT only to those students. Project 1 
also showed that perhaps treatment duration can be titrated according to 
the student’s needs. Our data indicated a fair amount of stabilization 
after only a few months of treatment for a portion of students. Some 
students who stopped treatment before seven months (and therefore 
were technically dropouts in the study) were doing quite well and noted 
that they did not feel they needed such intensive treatment (group and 
individual). Conversely, half of the students remained in treatment for 
the entirety of the 12-­month program, and some were referred for contin-
ued treatment immediately following the conclusion of the study.
The use of DBT skills training as a stand-­alone or adjunctive treat-
ment, such as in Project 2 above, will need to be empirically validated. 
An important next step in the application of DBT to CCCs is to conduct 
a stepped care study, where students are assigned to different levels of 
DBT care (e.g., skills group only vs. comprehensive). We question the 
efficacy of providing a DBT skills group alone with concurrent individual 
therapy of any orientation to this complex and high-­risk population. 
Crucial aspects of comprehensive DBT are missing, including individual 
DBT, 24-­hour skills coaching, and a formal consultation team. On the 
other hand, given the lack of affordable comprehensive DBT treatment 
available off campus in most areas of the country and some promising 
findings in terms of skills training alone in other settings (Feldman et al., 

================================================================================
DBT Applied to Severely Distressed College Students
41
2009; Harley et al., 2007), this practice is routinely followed across a 
number of other clinical environments (Dimeff & Koerner, 2007) and 
may be cautiously justified.
When utilizing DBT skills training alone as an adjunctive treat-
ment, we recommend considering the following factors:
a.	 Criteria for participation in DBT skills group alone needs to be 
evaluated with great care taking into consideration issues related 
to safety, needs of specific students, and group leader limits.
b.	 The individual therapist matters, particularly if she is not a DBT 
clinician. Therapists who are open to DBT and flexible in their 
approach, have a strong therapeutic relationship with the 
student, have a thorough and specific safety plan, are available 
between sessions for managing crises, and are willing to access 
consultation when needed appear to be associated with positive 
treatment outcomes in anecdotal observations. We recommend 
providing detailed DBT psychoeducation to individual thera-
pists who are not familiar with the approach.
c.	 Communication and collaboration with individual therapists is 
essential. This requires time, flexibility, and willingness on the 
part of group leaders and individual therapists. We have noticed 
that some students’ motivation and consistent attendance 
decline around mid-­semester, which we hypothesize may corre-
late with the increase in academic stress as the semester pro-
ceeds. We also wonder if this may be related to the fact that 
most students are not in individual DBT and thus are not receiv-
ing individualized skills coaching and attention to issues of 
motivation for practice of skills. Therefore, a weekly group con-
sultation time by conference call or in person with all those 
involved in the student’s treatment (e.g., skills group leaders, 
individual therapist in the community, psychiatrists) may be 
beneficial. Additional administrative time within the CCC to 
support the group leaders in managing the infrastructure of the 
program is essential.
d.	 Establishing and maintaining strong collaborative relationships 
with and between the group members, CCC, and community 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
42
therapists provides more containment for students and thera-
pists alike. For therapists, this may facilitate their capacity to 
manage extreme emotion dysregulation and high-­risk behaviors. 
In order to effectively provide a DBT Skills Group alone concur-
rent with individual therapy of any orientation, we believe it is 
essential to maintain these connections as a way to emulate the 
structure and support of a full DBT program. Of course, this 
requires additional time for skills group leaders and thus has a 
cost. However, we believe this approach may significantly con-
tribute to reducing therapist burnout and the pressure on CCC 
therapists and psychiatrists to manage crises without adequate 
clinical relationships.
e.	 Without DBT individual therapists, the task of maintaining 
motivation and commitment will fall on the group leaders. 
Perhaps closer collaboration and communication with individ-
ual therapists will help to address this issue. Asking individual 
therapists to sign a Group Agreement outlining their role and 
responsibility in collaborative treatment could be considered.
f.	
Treating students with BPD is difficult. It is for this reason that 
Marsha Linehan designed DBT to be a team-­driven treatment 
(Linehan, 1993a). In practice, many skills groups offered alone 
do not incorporate teams due to lack of support or knowledge on 
the part of other involved providers. Therefore, we highly rec-
ommend creating a team of involved, DBT-­informed treatment 
providers. Without a team, CCC treatment providers and clients 
can easily slide into therapy-interfering behaviors, or therapists 
can burn out. Without all of the elements of a comprehensive 
DBT program, group leaders become treatment team coordina-
tors and crisis managers.
In review, comprehensive DBT has been shown to be effective with 
college students. This chapter described some of those data. It also high-
lighted issues to consider in adapting comprehensive DBT or implement-
ing DBT skills training alone as an adjunctive form of therapy at a CCC.

Therapy (ACT):  
Processes and Application

magine two college sophomores presenting for services at a college 
counseling center. Both are majoring in biology with the intention of 
going to medical school. Both have wanted to be doctors their entire 
lives. Both study in demanding academic programs and encounter a 
great deal of stress. For each, the stress takes a similar internal form: 
worries about not performing well, feelings of anxiety and irritability, and 
frequent physical tension. However, each student has a very different way 
of responding to these experiences. The first student studies constantly, 
rarely leaving the library or taking a break. Although she is often well-­
prepared for exams and finishes assignments before they are due, other 
parts of her life suffer. She feels disconnected from her friends, whom she 
rarely sees, and she is constantly sleep deprived, over-­caffeinated, and 
underfed. Furthermore, despite her efforts, she does not feel she is really 
learning the material she studies, but rather absorbing it mechanically—
enough to get the grades she wants, but not in a way that really supports 
a deeper knowledge of biology. She wonders if she is truly cut out for a 
career in medicine.
The second student usually leaves his work until the last minute. 
Every Sunday night he can be found in his dorm room furiously attempt-
ing to finish his physics problem set—due Monday morning—long after

his roommate has gone to sleep. At other times, when he is hanging out 
with friends or trying to enjoy himself, a feeling of dread about the work 
he is putting off nags at him, sucking the pleasure out of everything he 
does. As a result, his relationships and health suffer: his friends notice he 
is barely present when he is with them, and he often plays videogames 
late into the night rather than going to bed, where he will inevitably 
encounter the worries that spring up as he is trying to fall asleep. Not 
surprisingly, his grades do not match his aptitude, and he also wonders if 
he is cut out for a career in medicine.
Though these patterns of behavior look very different, they have 
similar functions. The first pattern, which could be called “being driven,” 
and the second, which could be called “slacking off,” are both efforts to 
control worry, irritability, anxiety, and tension. For the first student, 
being driven keeps these thoughts and feelings at bay; if she slows down, 
they become more powerful. For the second, slacking off has the same 
purpose; the thoughts and feelings are most present when he begins to 
study, so he avoids studying as much as possible. Both patterns of behav-
ior have similar consequences to the students’ relationships, health, and, 
to some extent, academics (neither is getting much joy out of college). 
And despite the enormous time and effort devoted to “being driven” and 
“slacking off,” either intentionally or (more likely) out of habit, neither 
has a significant overall effect on the thoughts and feelings it is intended 
to control. Instead, it is quite likely these attitudes perpetuate them.
Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy: Opening Up and Doing 
What Matters
This chapter describes Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, 
said as one word) (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011), a mindfulness-­
based behavior therapy which seeks to unravel these patterns of respond-
ing. Rather than offering students a better way to control uncomfortable 
thoughts and feelings, however, ACT encourages students to develop a 
new relationship with them, one that is grounded in mindfulness. Using 
a variety of strategies, ACT helps students respond to thoughts and 

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
49
feelings with qualities that are either inherent in or follow closely from 
mindfulness. Painful experiences are encountered with openness and 
curiosity, welcomed with willingness and compassion, and observed 
without judgment or entanglement. At the same time, ACT encourages 
students to invest themselves in creating a vital and meaningful life 
based on what they care about most deeply, which oftentimes gets lost in 
the pursuit of struggling to control thoughts and feelings.
This chapter has two purposes: first, to provide an introduction for 
college counselors (or anyone working with college students) who are not 
familiar with ACT and, second, to offer mental health professionals who 
are familiar with ACT a guide for implementing it in individual counsel-
ing with college students. ACT theory and interventions are interwoven 
with case examples to highlight concepts and bring the reader into the 
consulting room.
The ACT Model of Psychopathology
The ACT model of psychopathology rejects the assumption, influenced 
by the medical model and some traditional psychologies, that psychologi-
cal health is characterized by the absence of psychological pain (Hayes et 
al., 2011). Instead, ACT assumes that psychological pain is a normal part 
of living and that excessive efforts to avoid pain can paradoxically lead to 
greater suffering. ACT targets a core pattern of behavior: experiential 
avoidance. Experiential avoidance entails attempts to change the inten-
sity, frequency, or duration of private events (anything in the subjective 
experience of an individual, such as thoughts, feelings, memories, and 
physical sensations), as well as efforts to avoid situations which give rise 
to those private events. Most college counselors are familiar with this 
process, if not these terms. A socially anxious student may avoid talking 
in class to prevent his peers from hearing his shaky voice and his mind 
from later ruminating about it. A depressed student may lie in bed to 
stave off feeling overwhelmed by the stress of classwork and extracurricu-
lar activities. An athlete suffering from panic attacks may avoid practic-
ing with her team to prevent elevating her heart rate and possibly trigger-
ing another attack. In these examples, the student engages in a marginally 
effective but ultimately self-­defeating effort to control aversive private 
events. Avoiding pain is necessary for survival: early humans would not

have passed on their genes had they not worked to alleviate hunger or 
avoid danger. In the modern world, staying away from fearful situations 
keeps us from walking into traffic or wandering down dark alleys. 
Experiential avoidance becomes problematic when it grows to be a gen-
eralized and inflexible pattern of running from thoughts and feelings 
even when doing so interferes with problem-­solving, relationship build-
ing, attending class, or anything else involved in living a full life.
Experiential avoidance is supported by fusion (Hayes et al., 2011), or 
the tendency shared by all people to allow mental events like thoughts, 
memories, meaning-­making, and narratives about the world to dominate 
over lived experience. Examples of fusion can be seen in the way evalua-
tions about the self and others, predictions about the future, rigid rules 
for living, and other products of the mind are treated as “truths,” or 
favored in such a way that they have a self-­defeating influence on behav-
ior. Again, most college counselors will be familiar with this dynamic. A 
student may ruminate on the thought “I’m going to fail this test” so 
deeply that she barely studies. A depressed student may think “Nothing 
matters” and live the thought out by rarely going to class and never cul-
tivating friendships. A socially anxious student may become so absorbed 
in monitoring his performance at a party that he misses half the conver-
sation he is having.
Fusion often goes hand-­in-­hand with experiential avoidance. For 
example, the student who ruminates about failing may stay away from 
studying because the thoughts become more powerful and are accompa-
nied by swells of anxiety as she sits down in front of her books. Fusion 
also has a role in framing private events (thoughts, feelings, memories, 
physical sensations, etc.) as “dangerous” or “bad,” making experiential 
avoidance seem the only logical response. For example, a student with 
frequent panic attacks is more likely to be influenced by the thought “I’m 
in danger” than by what his experience tells him—that he is safe despite 
his rush of adrenaline. As a consequence, he may do everything he can 
to stay away from external circumstances, like open spaces and large 
classrooms, and private events, like thinking about an exam, which give 
rise to that adrenaline rush. Some degree of fusion is necessary for living: 
without the capacity to be both absorbed in and guided by our thoughts, 
treating abstractions as “real things,” we could not plan for the future, 
learn from the past, or do any of the endless number of tasks that require 

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
51
thinking. But when fusion prevents living a life worth living, it is a 
problem worth addressing in counseling.
Experiential avoidance and fusion work in tandem with four other 
behavioral processes to create psychopathology and, more generally, 
human suffering (Hayes et al., 2011). Attachment to the conceptualized self 
is a special case of fusion in which a person attaches rigidly to narratives 
of identity, or who one is. Think of the student who believes deeply in the 
thought, “I am a bad test-­taker,” or the student who is so identified with 
her role as an athlete that she spirals into depression after an injury. 
Inflexible attention draws people into ruminating over the past or focusing 
excessively on the future. Think of the student who repeatedly recounts 
the same historical material over and over in counseling or the student 
who cannot stop worrying about an upcoming test long enough to take 
time to study. Disconnection from personal values leads people away from 
what truly matters to them, or prevents them from even identifying what 
matters; inaction, impulsivity, and avoidant persistence put this disconnec-
tion into practice. Think of the student who wants nothing more than a 
lasting relationship, and mitigates his loneliness by hooking up with a 
new partner each weekend. He fails to take the steps to cultivate a real 
relationship (inaction), allows his normal sexual attractions to exclu-
sively guide his behavior (impulsivity), and persists with this pattern 
despite the fact that it leaves him even more lonely (avoidant 
persistence).
Because these processes are not always maladaptive, but become 
maladaptive in particular contexts, ACT encourages students to con-
sider whether actions driven by them are “workable,” both in terms of 
what they are intended to achieve and, more generally, in the service of 
living a fulfilling life. In the case of the pre-­med students described in the 
introduction, the ACT counselor would likely explore with them whether 
efforts to control uncomfortable private events actually work: do the 
thoughts and feelings go away? Or do they fade into the background, 
only to emerge again? And do the students’ efforts to control private 
events take them in the direction of what’s important to them, like 
getting to know people, preparing for medical school, or having a rich 
college experience? If the answer is no, then ACT offers a model for 
encountering private events in a new way while at the same time pursu-
ing what matters.

ACT Intervention Strategies
ACT enlists a variety of strategies to support students in the process of 
accepting what cannot be easily changed (e.g., private events like ner-
vousness about finals and the pain of a breakup) and changing what can 
be changed (e.g., actions based on values, such as how one studies or 
behaves in a relationship). In addition to basic counseling skills like 
reflective listening and empathic attunement, as well as familiar cogni-
tive behavioral modalities like psychoeducation and homework, the 
ACT counselor uses strategies that are less common in counseling, such 
as metaphors and experiential exercises, including mindfulness (Hayes et 
al., 2011; Strosahl, Hayes, Wilson, & Gifford, 2004; Luoma, Hayes, & 
Walser, 2007; Harris, 2010). In ACT, these strategies are used to convey 
knowledge and facilitate learning in a way that is less intellectual and 
language driven and more intuitive and experiential.
Metaphors are the primary teaching tool of the ACT counselor. 
Rather than simply telling a student that acceptance is a viable alterna-
tive to control, the counselor would introduce a metaphor that illustrates 
the difference. For example, the counselor might compare acceptance to 
how one survives in quicksand, noting that what seems “right”—thrash-
ing one’s body to get out—will inevitably lead to sinking deeper, and what 
is counterintuitive—leaning back with arms and legs spread to increase 
one’s surface area—will keep one safely at the surface (Hayes et al., 2011).
Experiential exercises, which often incorporate both metaphors and 
mindfulness, are some of the most powerful tools in the ACT repertoire. 
To help a student notice thoughts as they occur in the moment, the coun-
selor might encourage her to imagine her thoughts as leaves in a passing 
stream (Strosahl et al., 2004) during a mindfulness exercise. To help a 
student experience what it could be like to accept his anxiety, the coun-
selor might have him visualize anxiety as an object and hold it gently with 
both hands, like something precious. To help a student understand what 
is most important to her, the counselor might ask her to visualize what 
she would like people to say about her at her funeral (Strosahl et al., 2004). 
These exercises, which can be woven throughout therapy, foster a kind of 
nonverbal knowing, one that is drawn more from experience and less 
from intellect. Experiential learning is important for all clients, but it is 
particularly relevant to students studying in a college or university envi-
ronment where relying on one’s intellect is more often rewarded.

The ACT Model for Intervention
Increasing Psychological Flexibility
The goal of these interventions, and ACT overall, is to increase the 
student’s psychological flexibility –­ the ability to contact the present moment 
as it is and persist or change behavior in the service of chosen values 
(Hayes et al., 2011). Psychological flexibility can be thought of as the 
opposite of entrenched patterns of experiential avoidance, fusion, discon-
nection from personal values, and the other processes noted above. A 
student acting in a psychologically flexible way treats painful thoughts 
and feelings as a natural part of life (not experiences to be avoided at the 
cost of living fully), allowing them to influence her actions only when 
doing so is useful and acting in the service of what matters to her.
A helpful way to think about psychological flexibility is in terms of 
patterns of responding. Psychological flexibility means marshaling a 
broad, flexible repertoire of responses to whatever life affords, including 
painful private events (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009). Some of these 
responses may entail experiencing more pain if encountering that pain 
serves something meaningful. For example, a first-­year student who fails 
her first calculus exam will likely feel disappointment and anxiety. In the 
face of these feelings, responding in a psychologically flexible way might 
entail a variety of responses, some productive, such as studying harder, 
seeking support from her parents and friends, or asking for help during 
her professor’s office hours. Some responses might be unproductive, such 
as spending the day in bed or surfing the Internet when she could be 
studying. A psychologically flexible student would move between these 
responses with some fluidity, eventually settling on the ones that are 
most useful in the service of what’s important to her. Thus, her repertoire 
of responding is both “broad”—she can respond in many ways—and 
“flexible”—she doesn’t get stuck in any one response. Some of her 
responses, such as talking with her professor, might temporarily precipi-
tate more anxiety in the form of worries about looking “dumb” or memo-
ries of the large, red “F” on her exam. A psychologically flexible student 
would choose this latter response (even though it would bring up more 
pain) in the service of something important, like succeeding 
academically.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
54
This focus on acting in a way that may bring one into contact with 
internal pain is not evidence of a “no pain, no gain” philosophy within 
ACT. It simply reflects the philosophy that some pain is unavoidable, and 
constant efforts to avoid pain can make life unlivable. ACT makes an 
important distinction between pain and suffering (e.g., Follette & 
Pistorello, 2007). Pain (sometimes referred to as “clean pain”) is a natural 
by-­product of living: if we love, then we will inevitably feel loss; if we 
pursue what matters, then we will inevitably fear failing. Suffering (some-
times referred to as “dirty pain”) is the result of efforts to stay away from 
pain when doing so takes us away from what matters. For example, if pain 
is feeling nervous upon meeting new people, then suffering is staying 
home on Friday night because of that fear. If pain is feeling sad when a 
relationship ends, suffering is drinking excessively to deaden the sadness 
of the loss.
In ACT, psychological flexibility is divided into six interrelated pro-
cesses: acceptance (opening up to experience), defusion (getting distance 
from the mind), self as context (perceiving a self that is distinct from 
thoughts and feelings), contact with the present moment (flexibly attend-
ing to experience as it happens), values (choosing what matters), and 
committed action (acting in the service of what matters). Note that each 
process is the antithesis of one of the six processes in the ACT model of 
psychopathology described above. Readers familiar with mindfulness 
practice will notice that the first four (acceptance, defusion, self as 
context, and contact with the present moment) all closely relate to mind-
fulness. In fact, in ACT these are considered four components of mindful-
ness. More generally, each of the six psychological flexibility processes can 
be thought of as a stance, or a way of acting, in the face of what life offers, 
whether private events or external circumstances. The bulk of ACT treat-
ment involves the counselor helping the student enact these processes in 
large and small ways, first in the counselor’s office and, ultimately, in life. 
A detailed summary of each process follows the next section.

the Problem
After the initial assessment is completed and informed consent is

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
55
flexibility, ACT begins with helping students uncover the maladaptive 
patterns of experiential avoidance (often referred to informally as “avoid-
ance and control”) playing out in their lives. This is often called drawing 
out the system (Luoma, Hayes, & Walser, 2007). The counselor might say 
to a student who procrastinates, “You’ve told me that when you are 
working you feel antsy and bored and you worry that you won’t finish in 
time. Tell me all the ways you deal with these thoughts and feelings.” 
With the counselor’s help, the student catalogs the variety of strategies 
he uses to avoid and control feeling antsy, worried, and bored. The list 
might be extensive: surfing the Internet, playing video games, hanging 
out in friends’ dorm rooms, checking his preferred social networking 
website, asking for extensions from professors, using excessive caffeine, 
rationalizing to himself that he needs to “take a break,” and waiting until 
the last minute so that his low motivation is overcome by the pressure of 
a deadline. The conversation then turns to the workability of these strat-
egies for minimizing feeling antsy, bored, and worried. Do these thoughts 
and feelings stop occurring? The answer is usually no. Do they some-
times get worse? The answer is often yes. (See “Appendix 3A: Avoidance 
and Control,” at www.newharbinger.com/22225) for a worksheet to help 
explore avoidance, control, and workability in a student’s life.)
In ACT, uncovering the lack of workability in avoiding and control-
ling thoughts and feelings, as well as the consequences of trying to do so, 
is called creative hopelessness (Hayes et al., 2011). “Hopelessness” refers 
not to one’s life being hopeless, but to a felt sense that continuing down 
the road of avoidance and control will lead nowhere. This hopelessness 
is “creative” in that it opens a vacuum into which new possibilities can 
enter. At this point, the student is usually a little puzzled and very curious 
about alternatives. This is where acceptance is first introduced.
Letting Go of the Struggle
The “Tug-­of-­War with a Monster” metaphor (Hayes et al., 2011) is 
useful to illustrate the difference between avoidance and control, on the 
one hand, and acceptance, on the other, and can be acted out experien-
tially. The counselor first gets the student’s consent to do an exercise in 
which both will hold onto either end of a “rope,” which can be anything 
suitably rope-­like, such as a scarf. The counselor then asks the student to 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
56
imagine that he is playing tug-­of-­war with a monster which is made up of 
all the discomfort he feels when he studies. The rope stretches across a 
deep pit into which he would plunge should he lose, so the stakes are 
high. Actually enacting this tug-­of-­war, rather than just talking about it, 
brings those stakes into sharp relief: the student feels the pull of the rope 
in his hands and can imagine sitting face to face with his discomfort. 
The counselor helps the student contact, both experientially and intel-
lectually, that there is no winning this game: the tug-­of-­war could go on 
forever because the monster is equally strong, if not stronger. The solu-
tion, which is really an anti-­solution, is to drop the rope. Most students 
realize this without it being explained. As they literally drop the “rope,” 
both the counselor and student feel a softness enter the room, and the 
student usually experiences, if only briefly, that he can be in the presence 
of his discomfort without having to change it.
The Six Core Processes of 
Psychological Flexibility
Figure 1, often called “The Hexaflex,” depicts the six core processes 
of psychological flexibility.
ACCEPTANCE
Letting go of struggling with painful thoughts and feelings makes 
space for the possibility of acceptance. In ACT, acceptance means 
opening up to all of our experiences, whether painful or pleasant, wel-
coming both the fear we may be desperate to reject and the joy we may 
hope to prolong (Hayes et al., 2011; Luoma, Hayes, & Walser, 2007). 
Acceptance the process is very different from the qualities often associ-
ated with “acceptance” the word; it is not giving in, giving up, or tolerat-
ing. Most importantly, acceptance is directed toward the pain encoun-
tered in difficult circumstances, not the circumstances themselves. An 
ACT counselor would not encourage a student to resign herself to medi-
ocre grades, unsatisfying friendships, or the fact of her depression. 
Instead, the counselor would support her as she encountered the fear and 
uncertainty of studying harder, taking risks in relationships, or creating 
a life that is not ruled by hopelessness and guilt.

Figure 1. The ACT Model
A useful synonym for acceptance, one which more easily sidesteps 
associations with resignation, is “willingness.” The counselor might ask a 
student who wants a romantic relationship but has never asked anyone 
out, “Would you be willing to have that fear of rejection and those but-
terflies in your stomach in return for the possibility of connecting more 
deeply with someone?” Or, the counselor might ask a student hoping to 
reduce the impact his binge drinking has on his life, “Would you be 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
58
willing to encounter that sense of ‘missing out on fun’ you describe for a 
chance at better grades and fewer mornings when you don’t remember 
anything?”
A variety of metaphors for acceptance are available throughout the 
ACT literature, many of which are included in “Pick a Metaphor,” an 
experiential exercise that can be conducted with individuals or groups 
(see “Appendix 3B: Pick a Metaphor Exercise”).
CONTACT WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT
Acceptance is supported by contact with the present moment, the 
process of bringing deliberate yet flexible attention to experience as it 
happens (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009). As in mindfulness practice, one’s 
attention is placed squarely in the moment, neither ruminating about the 
past nor worrying about the future, dispassionately following the con-
tinuous stream of experiential input encountered as time passes–­ for 
example, the gentle rise and fall of the breath in one’s body, the ever 
shifting texture of sounds in the aural landscape, or the play of light in 
the scope of one’s vision. ACT counselors encourage students to encoun-
ter their pain in just this way by slowing down and noticing it as it occurs 
without judging it or becoming absorbed in it. For example, a counselor 
might encourage a student who has an urge to binge and purge during 
session to sit quietly with eyes closed and watch the urge play out in real 
time. The student might notice that it starts with an agitated feeling in 
her arms and legs, followed by racing thoughts about where she can binge 
in secret and images of binge/purge episodes flashing in her mind. She 
might also notice that these experiences are not fixed, but rather ebb and 
flow over time. The counselor could observe that the urge can come and 
go without her doing anything about it.
DEFUSION
Defusion, the antithesis of fusion, entails treating the products of 
one’s mind, whether thoughts, images, memories, or meaning-­making, as 
simply the products of one’s mind—nothing more, nothing less (Hayes et 
al., 2011). Students are encouraged to engage thoughts only when they 
are useful in the service of something important, and to simply notice 
them when they are not. For example, a student with chronic depression 

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
59
might say to himself, “I’m no good at anything.” The ACT counselor 
would encourage him to notice the thought as it occurs, get distance 
from it, and explore the consequences of allowing it to have undue influ-
ence on his behavior. The student might notice that when “I’m no good 
at anything” occurs, he tends to withdraw from friends and procrastinate 
on classwork. If engaging with others and getting things done is impor-
tant to him, the counselor would help him encounter the thought mind-
fully, neither believing in it nor refuting it, while at the same time doing 
what matters.
Refraining from countering negative thoughts, repeating positive self-­
affirmations, and engaging in reappraisal is a unique feature of ACT, one 
that distinguishes it from many other therapies. In ACT, such strategies 
are considered further attempts to control private events, which risk 
making them more salient and reinforcing the belief that negative 
thoughts need to go away before the student can act differently. Instead, 
the counselor helps the student develop a different relationship with the 
thought, one that is more mindful and distant, one that becomes more 
about curious observation than automatic reactivity. In this context, a 
“negative” thought loses some of its power to direct a student away from 
meaningful living.
The counselor can enlist a wide variety of strategies to help facilitate 
defusion, some of which are playful and fun. A troublesome thought 
could be written on a 3x5 card and held closely or far away to illustrate 
the difference between being absorbed in a thought and simply noticing 
it (Hayes et al., 2011; Harris, 2010). The thought could be repeated 
quickly for a minute to illustrate that it is not only an evaluation or pre-
diction which feels powerful and scary, but also a collection of sounds, 
many of which become absurd as they somersault through one’s mouth 
(Hayes et al., 2011). The thought could be written on a piece of paper 
and carried in one’s pocket between appointments to illustrate that it 
can be welcomed, no matter how aversive it seems, at the same time one 
goes about one’s life (Hayes et al., 2011). Or, the student and counselor 
could imagine that their thoughts are like words passing across the 
bottom of the television screen on a news program and discuss what 
shows up on their respective “news crawls” (Hayes et al., 2011). Most 
simply, the counselor and student could cultivate a practice of creating 
distance from thoughts by prefacing what they say with “My mind says…” 
or “I’m having the thought.…”

The following process excerpt illustrates a defusion exercise that is 
inspired by two standard ACT defusion techniques: repeating thoughts 
over and over (mentioned above) and saying them in different voices 
(Strosahl et al., 2004). It also incorporates a discussion about the lack of 
workability in trying to control thoughts:
Counselor:	
This thought, “I’m not good at anything,” seems pretty 
powerful in your life.
Student:	
It’s true. I’m not getting the grades I want, I have no idea 
how to talk to girls, and I’m always pissing off my friends.
Counselor:	
Maybe we can look at this thought from a different angle. 
When it’s present and you’re really entangled in it, how 
do you act?
Student:	
I sit in my room watching television shows online. It 
blocks it out a little.
Counselor:	
That makes sense. But if you’re going to work on academ-
ics, talk to girls, or be a friend, I’m guessing that it’s likely 
to show up.
Student:	
Yes.
Counselor:	
I don’t think we could make it stop showing up right 
now—this pattern of thinking is pretty ingrained. One 
thing we could try to do is identify things you are 
actually good at. But I’m pretty sure you’ve tried that.
Student:	
Yeah, I’ve had long fights with myself about this.
Counselor:	
Did these fights make “I’m not good at anything” 
go away?
Student:	
Sometimes, but not for long.
Counselor:	
I’m not surprised. Often our efforts to change thoughts 
and feelings make them more of a problem. But if we 
were to “drop the rope” with this struggle, we might try 
something else. Would it be OK if we did something 
playful with “I’m not good at anything” today?

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
61
Student:	
I’ll try anything at this point.
Counselor:	
OK. First, I want you to hold it in your mind for a few 
moments and really allow yourself to be affected by it.
Student:	
(Closes eyes for a moment) OK.
Counselor:	
Now, for the next few minutes let’s have a conversa-
tion, but the only thing we get to say is “I’m not good 
at anything.” We’ll say it back and forth to each other 
in the cadences of a conversation, but if someone were 
listening from outside it would sound a little bit like we 
were speaking a different language, one in which the 
only words are “I’m not good in anything.”
Student:	
Weird.
Counselor:	
It is! Are you willing to see what happens?
Student:	
Sure.
Counselor:	
(Stated matter-­of-­factly) I’m not good at anything.
Student:	
(Hesitantly) I’m not good at anything.
Counselor:	
(Stated as a question) I’m not good at anything?
Student:	
(Firmly) I’m not good at anything!
Counselor:	
(Conversationally) I’m not good at anything.
Student:	
(In an offhand manner) I’m not good at anything.
The counselor and student go on like this for the next few minutes 
as they continue to speak as if in conversation. After a few minutes, and 
inevitably some laughter, they stop and discuss the exercise.
Student:	
I’ve had that thought many times before, but it seems 
different now.
Counselor:	
Notice it’s still the same thought. We haven’t really 
changed it in any way. However, we could say that you 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
62
are relating to it differently. You are not buying into it 
so much. Do you think that from this perspective you 
might be able to bring the thought with you as you do 
the things you need to do?
Student:	
Maybe. I’d like to try it out.
At this point, the counselor could give a homework assignment in 
which the student does something similar with the thought when it 
shows up. Or, the counselor could assign a writing assignment in which 
the student monitors troublesome thoughts and notices how they affect 
his behavior. (See “Appendix 3C: Noticing Thoughts that Hook You” for 
a worksheet useful for this purpose.)
Notice that the focus of this exercise is on changing the function of 
the thought, not the thought itself. When this thought (or other versions 
of it) occurs, it becomes dominant over everything else in his experience. 
The majority of the student’s responses become organized around it: he 
is escaping it, arguing with it, or following its lead. Saying the thought 
repeatedly undermines its dominance: it becomes merely a collection of 
words, one of many sentences generated continuously by the mind. In 
this space, when the student is no longer “fused” to the thought, wedded 
to it and weighed down by it, he is more capable of making choices that 
are guided by something else, like his values and goals.
SELF AS CONTEXT
Self as context refers to a special case of defusion in which the coun-
selor helps the student view the “self” as the container (i.e., context) of 
all of his experiences (Hayes et al., 2011; Harris, 2010). Whereas thoughts 
and feelings are always transient, coming and going throughout the 
course of one’s life, this aspect of self is experienced as continuous, like a 
sturdy house whose furnishings and occupants change over time (Hayes 
et al., 2011). ACT does not suggest that this is a “true self,” but rather a 
posture one can adopt to increase awareness and disidentify with private 
events. This posture can be contrasted with identifying with one’s con-
ceptualized self, described earlier, which is the constellation of narratives 
about who one is, such as “I’m a bad student” or “I’m not the kind of 
person who goes to parties.” From the perspective of the conceptualized 
self, a “bad student” can’t offer an insightful comment in a class 

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
63
discussion. But from the perspective of the self as context, a self which is 
bigger than “I’m a bad student,” these narratives are simply more thoughts 
and feelings one has.
Self as context is introduced through metaphors such as the “Sky” 
metaphor (Harris 2010), which characterizes the self as the sky, unharmed 
and unchanged in the face of constantly shifting—and sometimes very 
scary—weather. Self as context is a sense of self from which all experi-
ences are observed. The following excerpt shows a counselor introducing 
this concept experientially in session:
Student:	
When I start thinking about all the work I have to do, 
that’s when I start getting really anxious.
Counselor:	
Is the anxiety showing up right now as we are speaking?
Student:	
Yes.
Counselor:	
Okay. Would you be up for doing something a little bit 
different with the anxiety today? Let’s take a moment to 
break the anxiety down into its components. Let’s start 
with what it’s like physically. Notice where it manifests 
in your body and describe it to me.
Student:	
(After a few moments) I feel it in my shoulders and my 
chest. It’s like a big, heavy weight.
Counselor:	
Interesting. Is that big heavy weight always there, or does 
it come and go?
Student:	
It comes and goes, I guess.
Counselor:	
Okay. Let’s talk about the mental component of this 
anxiety. What goes on in your mind when it shows up?
Student:	
I think, “What’s wrong with me?”
Counselor:	
Anything else come up?
Student:	
I start imagining all the bad things that can happen.
Counselor:	
So it’s thoughts, but it’s also images. Those thoughts and 
images—are they always here or do they come and go?

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
64
Student:	
I guess they come and go.
Counselor:	
Okay, finally, let’s look at the emotions here. Would you 
describe anything inside you that is an emotion separate 
from these thoughts and physical sensations?
Student:	
I guess I would say I’m afraid.
Counselor:	
So let’s ask that question again—are you always afraid?
Student:	
It comes and goes. But lately it comes around a lot!
Counselor:	
So these physical sensations, thoughts, memories, images, 
and emotions are here sometimes, but they are not here 
at other times. What about you: do you come and go?
Student:	
(Looking a little puzzled) Of course not. I’m always here.
Counselor:	
Right. Close your eyes for a second and just notice that: 
no matter what is going on inside of you, there is a part 
of “you” there that is unchanged. Take a moment to 
really notice that it is different from everything going on 
inside of you.
Student:	
(After a few moments) I guess you’re right.
Counselor:	
It’s kind of like our student union building: it stands there 
year after year, as a lot of things inside it change: furni-
ture, the color of the walls, students, professors, ideas. 
These things shift over time—they come and they go. 
But the building basically stays the same. Just like you.
At this point, the counselor could suggest a homework assignment in 
which the student stops a few times a day and labels his thoughts, physi-
cal sensations, and emotions on paper. This exercise can provide at least 
two benefits: first, it objectifies the private events, which may provide a 
little freedom when they are especially powerful; second, monitoring 
over time highlights the transient nature of private events, because inevi-
tably the student will have different experiences to write about at differ-
ent points during the week. See “Appendix 3D: “A Functional Analysis” 
for a worksheet that also incorporates values and committed action.

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
65
VALUES
Values are chosen directions for living which are informed by what 
our experience tells us –­ and by what we imagine –­ brings meaning and 
vitality to life (Hayes et al., 2011). In ACT, students are encouraged to 
explore and articulate their values, which might include statements like 
“helping others,” “doing the best I can in school,” or “being open with 
the ones I love.” Notice that these statements are framed as actions, or 
qualities of being, rather than feelings or “things.” As such, values can be 
enacted in large and small ways in any given moment, regardless of the 
circumstances. A student who values “being thoughtful and honest” can 
enact these qualities with his boyfriend even during an argument. He 
could also be “patient and loving,” even though he does not feel espe-
cially patient and loving. Obviously, this is not always easy. But enlisting 
the four mindfulness processes noted above –­ acceptance, contact with 
the present moment, defusion, and self as context –­ makes it more pos-
sible. If the student mindfully watches his feelings ebb and flow from the 
perspective of an observer, holding lightly the angry thoughts that will 
likely arise, he can more easily be patient and loving.
Values are directions one can return to over and over again, much as 
someone practicing mindfulness returns to the breath as the mind 
repeatedly drifts away (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009). A student who strug-
gles with procrastination could write her academic values on a sticky 
note attached to her computer screen, reminding herself to be “curious, 
engaged, and hard-­working” as the inevitable urge to surf social network-
ing sites and the thought “this isn’t any good” arise again and again. A 
student working to stop arguing with his father during their weekly 
phone calls could do his best to be “respectful and considerate yet firm in 
my convictions” as frustration rises to the surface when he hears once 
again that his choice of major is wrong.
COMMITTED ACTION
The two examples above are instances of committed action: doing 
what it takes to bring values to bear in one’s life (Harris, 2010). The 
counselor supports the student engaging in a thoughtful pattern of com-
mitted actions –­ large and small –­ in the service of values. Committed 
action can involve outlining a series of values-­based goals or identifying 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
66
specialized skills to be learned. For example, a student with social anxiety 
could register for a public speaking class in the interest of becoming more 
capable in social situations and thereby better at building relationships. 
Committed action can also be a phase in counseling when traditional 
behavior therapy processes like exposure can be enlisted. For example, a 
counselor might spend a number of sessions helping a student with 
obsessive-­compulsive disorder practice contacting the present moment, 
welcoming his anxiety in a variety of ways, and articulating his values as 
preparation for exposure and response prevention with a graded hierar-
chy of avoided situations.
Integrating ACT Processes
Discussing the six components of psychological flexibility separately can 
give the false impression that each is wholly distinct from the others. 
However, readers will notice that each process incorporates elements of 
the others. For example, enacting acceptance by holding an aversive 
feeling in one’s awareness relies, at minimum, on both contact with the 
present moment and defusion (e.g., mindfully experiencing what the 
feeling is actually like without attaching meaning to it). The six-part 
model of psychological flexibility is best understood as a heuristic rather 
than a representation of what psychological flexibility is. As ACT coun-
selors develop in their understanding and skill, the processes begin to 
flow more seamlessly into one another. The counselor begins to think 
less in terms of how to help students defuse or accept, and more in terms 
of assisting them in showing up to life willingly and openly, moving in 
the direction of what is most important to them.
The following exercise, “Getting to Work,” incorporates all six pro-
cesses and can be used with students who procrastinate. It involves 
“exposure” to avoided coursework, performed in vivo in the counselor’s 
office. Just as in exposure therapy, where the counselor helps the client 
face a feared stimulus (e.g., an insect, dirt, or a physiological manifesta-
tions of anxiety), Getting to Work involves helping a student face an 
avoided assignment. However, in typical ACT style, and consonant with 
ACT variations on traditional exposure exercises (e.g., Eifert & Forsyth, 
2005), the feared stimulus is approached mindfully with the help of 
acceptance, defusion, self as context, and contact with the present 

================================================================================

67
moment skills. Furthermore, approaching the feared stimulus is framed 
as a committed action in the service of values. The counselor dissuades 
the student from taking a controlling stance toward private events, such 
as “toughing it out” or “gritting one’s teeth” through the anxiety. The 
following process excerpt provides an illustration:
Student:	
I still haven’t gotten started on that assignment we 
discussed last time.
Counselor:	
What does your mind say has to change before you can 
get started?
Student:	
It says I just need more motivation. So I mess around 
on the Internet or do something else until I start feeling 
motivated. But motivation rarely comes.
Counselor:	
My guess is that there is something uncomfortable that 
you are staying away from by procrastinating. Take a 
moment to close your eyes and imagine what would 
happen if you were to suddenly begin working. What 
kinds of thoughts, emotions, physical sensations show up?
Student:	
(Closes eyes) I’m starting to get a little anxious just 
thinking about it. My mind starts saying, “I’m no good 
at this” and “I’m going to fail.”
Counselor:	
So there is some anxiety, some evaluations of yourself, 
and some predictions about failure. What else?
Student:	
I’m getting antsy and getting the urge to get up and do 
something else.
Counselor:	
Go ahead and open your eyes. Is this what usually 
happens when you get started?
Student:	
Absolutely.
Counselor:	
I wonder if you might be willing to practice getting 
started right here in my office today. Usually your 
pattern is to avoid, avoid, avoid, until it becomes so late 
that you have to get started. What do you think about 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
68
getting started right now and working on noticing and 
welcoming everything that shows up?
Student:	
Start my paper? Right now?
Counselor:	
Yes. Do you have some work with you?
Student:	
I have my laptop.
Counselor:	
Great. Before we do it, let’s think for a second about 
why you would do your work. What values would be 
served by doing this work?
Student:	
Well, I really want to get a degree so that I can have a 
career that matters.
Counselor:	
So “having a career that matters.”
Student:	
Yes, and gaining knowledge also. That’s really important 
to me.
Counselor:	
In the service of having a career that matters and gaining 
knowledge, would you be willing to mindfully encounter 
all that stuff you just described?
Student:	
I can try.
(At this point, the student gets out her laptop and opens up a document.)
Counselor:	
(After about half a minute) Are your old friends 
showing up?
Student:	
Not all of them just yet, but I can feel that anxiety 
beginning to rise.
Counselor:	
Great. Can you welcome it in and bring it with you as 
you keep moving? Take a moment to observe it and 
breathe into it.
Student:	
Hello anxiety. (Pauses for a few moments and breathes 
deeply.) I’m going to start writing right now. (Begins 
typing for a few moments, then stops.)
Counselor:	
What just showed up?

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
69
Student:	
Those evaluations. My mind keeps saying that this is 
going to suck!
Counselor:	
Your mind is just doing what it is built to do: assess, 
predict, judge. Just notice all that with some compassion 
and keep writing.
(The student begins writing and the counselor backs off from the conversation 
for a few minutes.)
Counselor:	
How’s it going in there?
Student:	
Well, I was really anxious and pretty distracted for a 
couple minutes, but I kept working. Then I lost track of 
the anxiety for a while as I hashed out an idea.
Counselor:	
That stuff is probably going to come and go as you work. 
It’s only a problem when you let the thoughts and feelings 
be in charge.
Sometimes it is useful to do this exercise with objects representing 
private events. The counselor chooses objects from his or her office to 
represent the private events the student describes and places them next 
to her as she works. The counselor can also use 3x5 cards with thoughts 
and feelings written on them. As the conversation progresses, the student 
becomes surrounded by all of these “private events,” showing that she 
can continue working while they are present.
Counselor:	
Notice that you are working. And at the same time you 
are surrounded by “This is going to suck,” “I hate this,” 
anxiety, and everything else. It’s like you’re saying, “OK 
all of you, come along with me. We’re going to get some 
work done.”
Notice that each of the six processes is represented in this conversa-
tion: acceptance (breathing into a difficult feeling, “Hello anxiety”), 
defusion (noticing thoughts as thoughts), self as context (talking as if 
there’s a difference between the student and her private events), contact 
with the present moment (observing private events as they occur), values 
(naming “having a career that matters” and “gaining knowledge” as 
reasons for doing something uncomfortable), and committed action

(starting the assignment). This exercise is also an example of the way 
ACT can be implemented creatively: it draws on the theory and tech-
niques described in the ACT literature, but is uniquely tailored to college 
students.
Empirical Considerations
ACT has been subjected to over 60 randomized controlled trials and has 
proven effective for a range of problems, including depression, anxiety, 
obsessive-­compulsive disorder, chronic pain, worksite stress, diabetes 
management, and a host of others, including several studies with college 
students (see Ruiz, 2010, for a recent review). ACT research focuses not 
just on treatment outcomes, but also on processes of change (e.g., 
psychological flexibility) and whether these processes mediate, or 
can account for, outcomes (Hayes et al., 2011). ACT is listed as an 
evidence-­based treatment by the Clinical Psychology Division of the 
American Psychological Association (www.div12.org/psychological 
treatments/treatments) in a growing list of areas, including chronic pain, 
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed anxiety disorders, and 
psychosis, with the strength of evidence varying from moderate to strong 
depending on the specific area. It is currently being considered in other 
areas as well, including substance use disorders. ACT is also recognized 
as evidence-based by the United States Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (174.140.153.167/viewintervention.aspx 
?id=191).
In college students specifically, ACT has been studied in individual 
and group formats (e.g., Block & Wulfert, 2002), but this body of evi-
dence is in its early stages. However, the strong empirical support for 
ACT, as well as its applicability to a number of diagnoses, suggests it 
might provide a promising transdiagnostic treatment model for college 
counseling centers.
Final Words
Counseling centers see an ever-­increasing number of students with 
complex problems, yet resources are often limited, requiring session 

================================================================================
ACT: Processes and Application
71
limits and brief treatment (Gallagher, 2011). ACT can be a good fit for 
these limitations. Most ACT protocols are brief, and in settings with 
even more limited resources, counselors can weave ACT concepts like 
values and acceptance into brief interventions. For example, a problem-­
solving conversation about a roommate conflict could be grounded in 
identifying what cannot be controlled, such as the roommate’s personal-
ity and the student’s reflexive irritation, and what can be controlled, 
such as how the student approaches conflict. Sometimes a single state-
ment about acceptance and values can frame an entire conversation 
about “what to do.” For example, a counselor working with a distraught 
student who has recently failed a test might say:
“It makes sense that you would feel bad. It’s clear that academics are 
really important to you. Sometimes, in situations like this, we let feeling 
bad dictate our actions. We do things that make sense in the short term, 
like blowing off work or drinking alcohol, but that interfere with what 
matters to us. So if you were to let what’s important guide your next step, 
rather than trying to make this feeling go away (because it will eventu-
ally pass anyway), what would that look like?”
Notice that many ACT elements are embedded in this statement: 
pain is normal, control can be problematic, acceptance is an alternative, 
and one can commit to actions based on values.

CHAPTER 4
Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT) in Groups

I
n a conference room on the campus of a northeastern university, 
eight students walk slowly and silently around the room. Each is 
covered head-­to-­toe with 20-­30 adhesive name badge labels—the 
kind that usually say, “Hello, my name is.” Written on the labels in 
various colors of permanent marker are words and phrases like “worry,” 
“tension,” “I’m no good,” “nothing ever works for me,” and “depression.” 
The students pause briefly in front of signs posted around the room at 
eye level. Each sign has one word written on it in large letters: “work,” 
“school,” “family,” “love,” “fun,” “the future,” “community,” “friends,” or 
“health.” Eventually, the two other people in the room, group counselors, 
ask the students to sit down and spend a few moments reflecting.
Counselor 1:	 As you look around you, take a moment to observe 
your fellow group members… Allow yourself to really 
become aware of their presence… Notice the variety of 
experiences they have labeled on their bodies… Look 
down and notice all the experiences you have labeled 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
74
on your body… Notice that we all encounter a variety 
of experiences as we walk through life, including the 
inevitable pain of living… And now, when you are 
moved to speak, let’s discuss what we’ve experienced in 
this exercise.
Jennifer:	
Wow, it never occurred to me that everyone else here 
is just as crazy as I am! (Everyone laughs.)
Angela:	
I knew we were all dealing with some kind of depression 
and anxiety—that’s what this group is about—but it 
seems so normal now that I see it written on everyone’s 
bodies.
Lourdes:	
(Looking sad) I sure wish it wasn’t so normal.
Troy:	
Me too, but as we were walking around I was really 
beginning to understand this distinction between our 
feelings and ourselves. It’s like, here’s me, and here are 
my feelings. But I’m not my feelings. Now if I could just 
remember that when I’m having a panic attack! (Laughs)
Jennifer:	
I feel kind of sad. I can tell everyone in here has a lot 
of hurt.
Troy:	
Yeah, I felt the same way when we interviewed each 
other at the beginning of the exercise. Lourdes, I realized 
as I was asking you questions and writing your thoughts 
and feelings on these labels that I never have conversa-
tions like this. I felt really connected. But I also felt kind 
of sad—and mad also—that you have to go through 
what you go through.
(The group members sit in silence for a few moments.)
Counselor 2:	 Lourdes, what’s it like to hear Troy say that?
Lourdes:	
I agree. People at this school don’t really talk to each 
other. So we don’t really get to know one another. I 
think people here are really self-­centered. Like, this one 
time, I was hanging out in my dorm when…

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
75
Counselor 2:	 Lourdes, if I may interrupt for a second. Can you pause 
and check in with yourself? See if you can observe what 
thoughts and feelings show up in response to what Troy 
said. What else could you put on the labels you are 
wearing?
Lourdes:	
(Pauses) It’s hard to describe. It feels good but also kind 
of scary. I kind of want to run away. (Pauses) It’s like 
when we walked around the room and I walked towards 
“friends”: I got a knot in my stomach. Getting close to 
people is not something I really do.
This process excerpt illustrates a modified version of “Label Parade,” 
an experiential exercise first described in Walser and Westrup (2007), 
conducted in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT: Hayes, 
Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011). The exercise is designed to facilitate self as 
context, one of the six processes of psychological flexibility (see chapter 
3 for a description of all ACT processes). The exercise is usually con-
ducted during the sixth session of a semester-­long counseling group for 
depression and anxiety. The students begin by breaking into pairs and 
taking turns interviewing each other about situations in which difficult 
private experiences are likely to arise. Every time the speaker identifies a 
thought, feeling, or physical sensation, the interviewer writes it on a 
name badge and hands it to the speaker. The speaker then sticks it on his 
or her body. After 15-­20 minutes of interviewing, the group members 
walk silently around the room, stopping in front of signs identifying 
domains of values posted on the walls.
Conducting this exercise in a group enhances its effectiveness. The 
students are able to observe not just the distinction between themselves 
and their private experiences, but also the distinction between the other 
members in the group and their private experiences. Participants can 
experience firsthand, albeit in a metaphorical way, that they can carry 
their pain with them as they move toward what is important. They can 
also reflect on the exercise with one another, thereby enhancing their 
learning, and observe, with the help of the counselors, what it stirs up 
between them. As a social microcosm (Yalom, 2005), and therefore a 
setting in which each member is likely to play out his or her habitual 
interpersonal behaviors and roles, a group is fertile ground where experi-
ential avoidance, fusion, and disconnection from values—the targets of 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
76
ACT—are likely to take root. Notice that Lourdes’s pattern of avoiding 
meaningful connections with others in her daily life shows up in her 
interaction with Troy. However, a group also provides rich opportunities 
for students to practice the processes encouraged by ACT–­ acceptance, 
defusion, contact with the present moment, self as context, values, and 
committed action—so that they may bring them to bear in their lives 
outside of the group.
This chapter describes ACT in a group format in college counseling. 
It uses chapter 3, which describes the ACT theoretical model and prin-
ciples, as a starting point. It offers suggestions for structuring and facili-
tating ACT groups and describes a number of experiential exercises tai-
lored specifically to college students.
The Benefits of ACT in Groups
Groups are an important part of the services college counseling centers 
provide (Eichler & Schwartz, 2010), and ACT is well suited to groups. 
The therapeutic factors unique to groups (Yalom, 2005) have the poten-
tial to both enhance and be enhanced by the six processes of psychologi-
cal flexibility. For example, the sense of universality (Yalom, 2005)—of 
being “in the same boat” (Shulman, 2011)—that groups foster can have 
a powerful effect on acceptance; making space for one’s panic symptoms 
can be easier when one becomes aware that others struggle with panic as 
well, and that fear is a human experience rather than something that 
marks one as different. Groups also offer social support (Yalom, 2005) for 
making changes; taking risks in the service of a meaningful life can seem 
more possible with the encouragement of fellow group members. 
Furthermore, groups allow students to learn by example as participants 
model new behaviors for one another, whether noticing one’s self-­
defeating thoughts or committing to doing what it takes to perform 
better academically. Finally, as noted above, and perhaps most important 
for building patterns of psychologically flexible interpersonal behavior, 
groups offer a safe space where students can practice relating differently 
to others as they become aware of the influence of fusion and experien-
tial avoidance on their relationships. Yalom (2005) calls this interper-
sonal focus “the engine of group therapy” (p. xvi).

ACT Groups and College Counseling 
Centers (CCCs)
College counseling centers (CCCs) have unique needs which influence 
what kinds of groups are offered and how groups are run. First, CCCs 
often have limited resources and enlist a time-­limited treatment model, 
yet the problems students present with are becoming more severe and 
complex (Gallagher, 2011). Therefore, effective short-­term interventions 
for students struggling with multiple problems are necessary. Second, 
because of the variety of presenting problems for which students seek 
help, it can be difficult to compose a group with members who share a 
common diagnosis; it is more common that group members will carry a 
variety of diagnoses, regardless of the “theme” of the group.
These factors make ACT groups a good fit for CCCs. ACT theory 
suggests that experiential avoidance is a core process operating in most 
psychological disorders (Hayes et al., 2011), and studies have shown that 
ACT can successfully reduce experiential avoidance and increase psy-
chological flexibility across a variety of presentations (see Ruiz, 2010, for 
a recent review). Furthermore, ACT has shown efficacy as a short-­term 
group intervention for a wide range of problems (e.g., Zettle & Rains, 
1989; Bach & Hayes, 2002; Pearson, Heffner, & Follette, 2010), and 
ACT in a group format has been “road tested” with high satisfaction 
ratings in a busy CCC (See Empirical Considerations at the end of this 
chapter for a brief description of the pilot study for which many of the 
materials and exercises discussed here were created).
Facilitating ACT Groups: The Basics
We will outline below some factors to consider in running ACT groups 
at CCC.
Composition
Whether an ACT group should be composed of students who share 
a specific problem (e.g., procrastination) or students who present with a 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
78
variety of problems depends on a number of factors, including the pool of 
students willing to participate in group, the CCC’s resources, and the 
training and interests of the staff. Though composing a group for a single 
diagnosis—e.g., dysthymic disorder—can be difficult, composing a group 
for a broader category of diagnoses—mood disorders—can be much 
easier. Consider an ACT group composed entirely of students with 
anxiety disorders. The group could focus exclusively on the dynamics of 
anxiety, including manifestations (e.g., panic, worry, and physiological 
arousal) and the behaviors that sustain it (e.g., avoidance of anxiety-­
producing situations). The participants could provide encouragement for 
one another as they expose themselves to feared situations and private 
experiences while pursuing valued directions. Furthermore, the group 
could be structured around an existing 12-­session ACT protocol for 
anxiety disorders (Eifert and Forsyth, 2005) that can be easily adapted to 
a group format. Indeed, one of the authors (J.C.) has done just that. 
However, as noted above, CCC groups may need to be heterogeneous, 
especially in small centers with limited resources. One benefit of hetero-
geneous groups is that students can observe the role of experiential 
avoidance and fusion in a variety of problems and experiment with new 
behaviors with feedback from other students who represent the diversity 
of their social world.
Orienting Students to Group
Interested students can be oriented in an individual meeting with 
one of the group leaders, who might describe the group as follows:
“This group is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, 
or ACT. ACT assumes that pain is a normal part of living and 
that excessive efforts to avoid pain can lead to greater suffering. 
You will have the opportunity to explore how your painful 
thoughts and feelings affect your life, experiment with different 
ways of relating to them, and learn how to pursue your values 
more fully.”
Individual group orientation meetings can also provide preliminary 
opportunities to explore the role of unworkable avoidance and control in 
students’ lives and introduce willingness as an alternative. It can be 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
79
useful to facilitate a brief experiential exercise during orientation meet-
ings, both to introduce potential group members to the experiential 
nature of ACT and to provide a window into what the group will be like. 
To these ends, both the “Butterfly” (see below) and the “Tug-­of-­War with 
a Monster” (see chapter 3) are useful, as is any ACT exercise with which 
the counselor is comfortable. A sample flyer advertising an ACT group, 
which can be given to students before or during an orientation meeting, 
is included as Appendix 4A at www.newharbinger.com/22225.
Group Norms
Readers familiar with group counseling will need no introduction to 
the necessity of confidentiality, regular attendance, and other group 
norms. Other readers are urged to consult the wealth of information in 
the group literature (e.g., Yalom 2005; Shulman 2011). One norm worth 
explicating in more detail here is refraining from “rescuing” other group 
members (Walser and Pistorello, 2004). “No rescuing” means allowing 
fellow members to have their feelings without trying to solve them. A 
handout for group members, “Appendix 4B: Group Considerations,” says 
the following about rescuing:
As we get to know one another, group members will begin to 
share personal details about their lives, feelings, and thoughts. 
Our normal reaction when someone is suffering is to try to help 
them get away from their pain. We do this by urging them to 
look on the bright side, by offering them solutions, or by telling 
them it’s going to be all right. In this group, we call these strate-
gies “rescuing.” We are going to try not to rescue each other in 
group—not because it’s a bad thing to do, but because it’s a 
strategy for controlling feelings. In this group, we will attempt to 
encounter pain without trying to change it. This might not com-
pletely make sense right now. But we will talk more about it as 
we proceed with the semester.
This passage, which can be discussed in the first group meeting 
along with other group considerations, sets the stage for conversations 
about each group member’s reactions to the pain of others. The “no res-
cuing” norm is likely to be broken often, both by group members and 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
80
leaders: it’s a well-­oiled part of most of our behavioral repertoires. 
However, everything is “grist for the mill,” in that each attempt at rescu-
ing provides an opportunity to discuss the interpersonal effects of trying 
to tamp down the feelings of others, as well as how this strategy, which is 
usually automatic, is both a manifestation of one’s own discomfort with 
pain and also a potential barrier to interpersonal connection.
Group Format
ACT groups usually include some combination of education, mind-
fulness exercises, experiential exercises, group discussions, and home-
work exercises. A typical ACT group might start with a mindfulness 
exercise to lay the groundwork for a present-­focused and self-­aware dis-
cussion. Next, the group might discuss homework given during the previ-
ous session, whether a worksheet, a reading from an ACT self-­help book, 
or a daily mindfulness exercise. The group leaders could then move on to 
a brief introduction of one of the six core processes of psychological flex-
ibility, augmenting the instruction with interactive exercises to help stu-
dents learn both intellectually and experientially. As the meeting pro-
gresses, group members could reflect on how the topic being discussed 
applies to their lives. These conversations provide a good opportunity for 
members to provide feedback to one another, as well as for group leaders 
to facilitate discussions about present-moment experiences. For example, 
group members might be encouraged to notice what their minds are 
saying about the discussion, observe what feelings are stirred up in 
response to their fellow group members, and consider what interpersonal 
behaviors might best serve their values. The facilitators might end the 
group by assigning a homework exercise based on the topic of the day.
INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS EXERCISES
Although mindfulness exercises are a good way to start (and some-
times end) group, mindfulness can be incorporated at any point during 
the meeting to assist students in witnessing what thoughts and feelings 
arise in response to others and observing where fusion and avoidance 
might be directing them away from values-­driven actions. A brief process 
excerpt:

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
81
Counselor:	
I notice we seem to have gotten away from today’s topic: 
values. There is nothing wrong with that, but our distrac-
tion might tell us something about ourselves. Let’s slow 
down for a minute and reconnect with the present. Start 
by noticing your breathing… Next, scan your body and 
notice any physical or emotional discomfort… Finally, 
take a second to watch your mind as your thoughts go 
by… What do you notice?… Let’s talk about it.
Esteban:	
I notice a heaviness in my chest. I think it’s sadness.
Counselor:	
Where do you think it comes from?
Esteban:	
I’m so aware today that I’ve been ignoring what I care 
about in school. I’ve just been skating along in my classes, 
doing the minimum. That’s not what I want to be about.
Counselor:	
And although we might want to condemn sadness as 
“bad, “ notice that it is telling you something important. 
It’s like a little alarm letting you know you have drifted 
away from what you care about. Anybody else notice 
anything?
HOMEWORK
ACT comes from the behavioral and cognitive traditions in psychol-
ogy and therefore emphasizes developing skills that can be generalized 
outside of counseling. To do this, some kind of homework is essential. 
Homework can be almost any activity which raises awareness or fosters 
skill building, from the simple act of stopping once a day to take an 
observer’s perspective on one’s thoughts and feelings to the more time 
intensive practices of completing worksheets, reading book chapters, and 
engaging in regular mindfulness. “Appendix 4C: Examples of Homework 
Assignments and/or Group Exercises,” provides a number of possibilities; 
see also “Appendix 1A: Self-Help Books,” for a list of self-help titles that 
can be used for between-session reading.
Group leaders should be mindful of the academic, vocational, and 
extracurricular demands on students’ schedules and assign just enough 
homework to make a difference, but not so much that it 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
82
feels overwhelming. Also, leaders must be sure to discuss the previous 
meeting’s assignment in each meeting, lest members get the impression 
that homework is not important to complete. When group members do 
not complete homework, group leaders can facilitate a discussion about 
how experiential avoidance and fusion might have gotten in the way.
One useful assignment for college students is “Willingness with an 
Avatar,” which entails carrying an avatar of a painful private experience 
between meetings and interacting with it as one would a welcome guest. 
Students are encouraged to pick any object that can usefully stand in for 
their private experiences: a rock, a 3x5 card with a word written on it, an 
action figure, a piece of string, etc. A facilitator can introduce the exer-
cise by showing the group her own avatar (e.g., a small stuffed animal 
representing “fear of failure”) and asking members to imagine the avatar 
sitting next to her computer monitor as she checks e-­mail in the morning 
and, later, meets with clients. The facilitator could explain that she does 
not have to like the avatar to welcome it, but that treating it with kind-
ness and compassion lessens its power. The exercise becomes a fun way 
to practice developing new relationships with painful thoughts and feel-
ings by incorporating self as context (noting the difference between 
oneself and one’s feelings), acceptance (welcoming painful feelings), 
defusion (letting go of the meanings usually associated with painful feel-
ings), and values (moving forward in life despite the presence of pain). 
Detailed instructions for this exercise are included in Appendix 4C.
INTRODUCTORY EXERCISES
An exercise which can be used to experientially introduce accep-
tance is “The Butterfly,” which is inspired by Harris’s (2009) “clipboard” 
exercise and the ACT metaphor which encourages one to hold a private 
experience like a butterfly that has landed on one’s hand (Hayes et al., 
2011). In The Butterfly, multiple ways of responding to private experi-
ences are acted out by group members. Students are divided into pairs, 
and one half of the pair volunteers to pick a difficult private experience 
with which she is willing to do something playful. The other half of the 
pair is called “Life” and assists the volunteer with the exercise. The vol-
unteer is given a card (e.g., a 3x5 index card) on which to write the 
private experience, which can be represented by a symbol instead of a 
word if she does not want it to be known to her partner. The pairs are

asked to find a place in the room where they can have a little bit of space 
to interact.
Counselor:	
Volunteers, please hand your card to Life. Face each 
other standing about 5 feet apart. Life, hold the card up 
with one hand so that it’s facing your partner. 
Volunteers, take a good look at the card: this is your 
pain. Notice your immediate reactions to it. (Some of 
the students grimace and cringe.) I’m going to ask you to 
interact with it in a variety of ways. This exercise will be 
a little bit physical, so everyone should make sure to be 
careful. We don’t want to add any new injuries to the 
pain you already have! 
    First, I would like you to gently press your hand 
against the hand of Life, holding the card between your 
hands… Now, add a little pressure. (The members of 
each pair begin pushing their hands against one 
another.)… Without getting too carried away, put a 
little bit more pressure on… Notice what happens in 
your body as you try to push the pain away. (The 
students begin visibly straining against one another.)… 
Notice all the effort this takes… Now back off the 
pressure… Go back to just holding the card between 
your hands… Tell me, has the card gone away?
Kelly:	
No. It’s still here.
Counselor:	
Okay, notice that. Next, I would like volunteers to take 
the card from Life and hold it by its edges… Take a look 
at the card and let yourself become absorbed in it. This is 
your pain… Now squeeze the card as tightly as you can… 
Really put some effort into it. (The arms of some students 
are visibly shaking as they squeeze as hard as they can.)… 
Notice what that’s like. Don’t think about it too much. 
Just experience it… Now release the pressure and simply 
hold it in your hands… Someone tell me, has the card 
gone away?
Jackie:	
Nope, it’s still here. But mine’s pretty wrinkled!

================================================================================

84
Counselor:	
Wrinkled, but still there. Notice that… Now, we are 
going to do something a little bit more physical, so 
everyone be careful… Life, take the card back and hold 
it again so that it’s facing your partner. When I give the 
cue, Life, start walking toward your partner. Volunteers, 
this is your pain. I want you to try to escape from it. Do 
whatever you can. Ready—go! (Group members begin 
moving around the room, some of them even running to 
get away from their pain. Members inevitably bump into 
one another. There is a lot of giggling and laughter. The 
counselor shouts over the din.) Notice what’s going on 
right now… Notice the effort that you are putting into 
escaping… And when I give the cue, everyone stop 
where they are… Stop! (The students freeze in their 
tracks, many of them in comical positions.) Go ahead 
and relax. Someone tell me, is the pain gone?
Esteban:	
(Panting and laughing) No. It’s right here with me. Just 
like in real life.
Counselor:	
Okay, notice that. Now we are going to do just one more 
thing. Everyone, face your partners again. Life, hold the 
card so that it’s facing your partner. Volunteers, this is 
your pain. Life, slowly—­very slowly—­hand the card face 
up to your partner. Volunteers, hold out both hands and 
accept the card… Allow the card to land gently on your 
open hands as if it were a butterfly… Hold it gently like 
something precious, like something you would take care 
of… Now, while you’re holding it, look around the room 
at the people around you… Look at the person in front of 
you and take in their humanity… And look down at the 
card again… Notice what this is like… Notice what it’s 
like in your body… Now, someone tell me, is the card 
gone?
Robin:	
(Softly) Still here.
Counselor:	
What’s different?
Robin:	
I’m different.

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
85
Counselor:	
How do you mean?
Robin:	
I’m more relaxed and open. I don’t have so much energy 
devoted to the card. It’s just a card.
Counselor:	
Nice. What else do people notice?
The counselor then facilitates further exploration of the exercise. 
Some students “get” this new relationship with their private experiences 
right away, but others have difficulty understanding how responding 
with acceptance is possible. Some worry that the feeling will never go 
away if they do not do something about it. As a response to this concern, 
the counselor could ask what might happen if a butterfly did indeed land 
on their hands. Would it stay? Maybe. Would it fly away? Eventually. 
Acceptance is like that: allowing your feelings to do what they will 
without trying to change them. At the same time, one can choose one’s 
actions—e.g., looking around the room, taking in the humanity of one’s 
partner. Some students say they understand the exercise, but wonder 
how they can actually make this new relationship happen in their lives. 
The counselor could respond that this is what the group is about: over 
the course of the semester, the group will practice, in a variety of ways, 
opening up like this to thoughts and feelings.
Although explaining the exercise in detail to group members would 
likely diminish its power and it’s not recommended, some of its nuances 
are worth exploring here. The exercise is used to introduce acceptance, 
but elements of other processes are present as well. As noted in chapter 
3, no ACT process is wholly distinct from the others. All are interrelated 
facets of psychological flexibility. Holding the private experience like a 
butterfly is an accepting posture, one that is open and gentle with a 
thought or feeling that otherwise might be suppressed, fought, or ignored. 
Writing the name of the private experience on a card and interacting 
with it metaphorically encourages a defusing posture, one in which the 
private experience is treated as merely an experience, rather than some-
thing “bad.” Contact with the present moment is brought to bear in the 
counselor’s direction to notice what’s going on in one’s body during the 
exercise and to notice that the card does not go away. It helps students 
observe the actual results of avoidance and control strategies rather than 
what the mind says “should” happen. Interacting with a private experi-
ence in this way can also facilitate self as context: a distinction is made 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
86
between the self and the thoughts and feelings the self experiences, 
which opens up the possibility of responding flexibly (e.g., in more func-
tional ways) when painful thoughts and feelings are present. Finally, 
“taking in the humanity of the person in front of you” is about values and 
committed action, if only briefly and subtly. It is rare to encounter a 
person who does not care about relationships in some way, regardless of 
how anxious, defensive, or angry she might be in the presence of others.
WORKING IN THE HERE AND NOW
In any counseling group, there is a dynamic tension between discuss-
ing events that happen outside the group and those that happen inside 
the group. A certain amount of talking about one’s daily life, as well as 
one’s life history, is necessary for group members to build relationships 
with one another. Without it, there is no frame of reference from which 
the group can discuss the impact of experiential avoidance, fusion, and 
disconnection from values on their lives. From an ACT perspective, 
however, narrating one’s life can also be part of the problem. Excessive 
attachment to thoughts and beliefs about one’s life (i.e., fusion), mentally 
inhabiting the past and the future (i.e., lack of present moment focus), 
and clinging to stories about who one is (i.e., failing to flexibly move 
between the self as context and the conceptualized self—see chapter 3) 
work in synchronicity with experiential avoidance and disconnection 
from values to create suffering. Therefore, it is necessary for counselors to 
encourage the group members to look beyond the content of what they 
are saying to discover what’s happening within them and between them. 
Readers familiar with group counseling will recognize this as the “group 
process,” and attending to it has been called “working in the here and 
now” (Yalom, 2005).
Working in the here and now helps the group members to make 
therapeutic use of the interpersonal patterns that manifest in the group. 
This is true in any counseling group. However, in an ACT group, in 
which students are learning to notice experiential avoidance and fusion 
as they show up, this process can be especially powerful. With the help of 
the acceptance and mindfulness skills they are learning, and the support 
of the group counselors, students can talk about and work through their 
reactions to one another as they happen. Furthermore, ACT gives stu-
dents a vocabulary with which to talk about these experiences in a 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
87
nonjudgmental way and a roadmap for responding differently to them. 
The following process excerpt gives an illustration. It occurs midway 
through the third group meeting, after mindfulness, acceptance, and 
defusion have been introduced.
Counselor 1:	 Thanks, everybody, for your comments on the Butterfly 
exercise. Robin, I notice as we’ve been talking you’ve been 
kind of silent. Can you share what’s going on for you?
Robin:	
(Tears welling in her eyes) I haven’t wanted to talk 
because I’m trying not to cry. I’m just realizing how 
much wasted effort I have put into struggling with my 
anxiety. When I could have been making friends and 
having fun these past couple of years, I’ve been living in 
fear, listening to my mind tell me that sharing anything 
about myself is too risky.
Kelly:	
But here you are in this group, working on it. That’s good, 
right? You just have to keep trying.
Counselor 2:	 Kelly, it sounds like it’s really hard for you to see Robin 
in pain.
Kelly:	
(Pauses) That was rescuing, wasn’t it?
Counselor 2:	 (Smiles) I was wondering. You tell me.
Kelly:	
I think it was. It’s really hard for me not to try to make 
things better.
Counselor 2:	 Tell me what’s going on inside of you.
Kelly:	
I can’t sit still. I feel like I want to jump out of my seat and 
give Robin a hug. I don’t know the people in this group 
really well yet, but I care about what happens to her.
Counselor 1:	 I bet that we are all having some kind of strong reaction. 
And whatever you are feeling is probably kind of familiar. 
You have probably felt some version of it before. It really 
has nothing to do with Robin. We all enter this room 
with a whole history that has shaped how we are in 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
88
relationships, including how we respond to the pain of 
others. Can other group members share their reactions?
Esteban:	
I’m embarrassed to say this, but I have an urge to leave 
the room. I’m just no good at dealing with other people’s 
issues. I’m afraid I will make them worse.
Jackie:	
I get kind of sad, thinking of all the bad things that have 
happened in my life. I guess I kind of get “hooked” by all 
of my own negative thoughts and feelings. I’m off in my 
own head, barely listening to what’s going on.
Counselor 1:	 If you were to allow those thoughts and feelings to be 
there, but act on something else—­say, how you want to 
be in relationships—­how would you respond to Robin?
Jackie:	
I guess I might just listen. I might ask some questions 
too—­get to know what she’s going through.
The counselors could take this interaction in many directions. They 
could encourage the group to continue talking about their responses to 
the pain of others and how those responses might help or hinder building 
relationships. They could explore with the other group members, as they 
have with Jackie, how they might respond in a values-­driven way while 
mindfully welcoming their thoughts and feelings. Or they could return to 
Robin, exploring what it is like to be open about her pain, and encourage 
her, if she’s willing, to continue trying on a new interpersonal behavior: 
openness. Notice, however, that none of these interventions focuses on 
the content of the conversation, but rather on the process. Furthermore, 
the process encompasses both what is going on in the here and now and 
also how what is going on in group mirrors what happens for the students 
in their relationships outside of the group.
ADVANCED EXERCISES
Once students have been introduced to the basics of ACT through 
didactics, metaphors, discussions, readings, and experiential exercises, 
the group counselors can incorporate more advanced exercises to 
enhance the participants’ experiential learning. By “advanced” we mean 
exercises that are more likely to stir up discomfort and therefore require 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Groups
89
a greater deal of willingness on the part of group members. “Label 
Parade,” which introduces this chapter, is one such exercise. Recall that 
it requires students to interview one another about painful private expe-
riences and then stick name badge labels with the experiences written on 
them on their bodies. Asking students to be vulnerable with one another 
in this way requires a level of group development that is unlikely to be 
achieved in the first few sessions. Facilitators will need to pay attention 
to the degree of cohesion and trust present in the group before moving 
on to such exercises. That being said, under the right circumstances, a 
powerful exercise can help shepherd a group which is struggling to cohere 
into a more trusting and collaborative space.
Another such exercise is “Eyes On” (or “Eye Contact”; Hayes, 
Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999). Eyes On involves asking participants to split 
into pairs and sit facing one another with their knees touching. Over the 
course of 5-­10 minutes the participants look into the eyes of their part-
ners while willingly encountering whatever arises within themselves. 
Obviously, this is quite different from most social interactions; it is rare 
to engage another person without looking away periodically to modulate 
the intensity of connection. Maintaining eye contact requires the student 
to encounter a variety of experiences, from the relatively predictable and 
mundane, such as the urge to giggle, to the more unexpected and pro-
found, such as judging oneself and one’s partner while simultaneously 
feeling the vitality of greater intimacy. Depending on the student, Eyes 
On can simply offer practice at doing something uncomfortable or it can 
provide an enlightening tour of the variety of internal reactions one can 
encounter in close relationships. A process excerpt follows:
Counselor:	
Now let’s bring the exercise to an end. Thank your 
partner in any way you see fit.
(Some smile. A few laugh. One pair bows.)
Counselor:	
Let’s talk about the experience.
Johan:	
It was really hard at first. I really wanted to laugh. I kept 
worrying about what my face looked like, and then I was 
criticizing myself for not doing it right.
(Other group members chime in, noting similar feelings as well as less 
uncomfortable experiences, like feeling peaceful or connected.)

================================================================================

Counselor:	
How might your reactions tell you something about your 
relationships?
Esteban:	
I’m not sure doing this tells me anything about my 
relationships. I don’t really ever sit like this with anyone.  
I just felt really wiggly and impatient.
Counselor:	
Perhaps it doesn’t have anything to do with your 
relationships. But maybe “wiggly and impatient” mirrors 
something in your life. I’ll give an example from my own 
life. The first time I did this exercise, at a training 
conference for counselors, I found myself thinking very 
critical thoughts about my partner—just judging like 
crazy. It reminded me of something I’ve learned before 
about relationships: when I get close to somebody, it’s 
kind of scary, and I tend to get judgmental to protect 
myself. One of the things that the exercise really made 
clear was that my judgments are about me and my 
discomfort, not so much about the person I am with.
Esteban:	
I get it, I think. I guess I am prone to being impatient 
with people I care about. It never occurred to me it 
might be a reaction to being close to them.
Counselor:	
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn’t. Perhaps this is something 
you could pay attention to over the next few weeks to see 
what you notice.
Obviously, a counselor’s self-­disclosure should always be carefully 
considered and accompanied by a clear clinical rationale. When thought-
fully executed, self-­disclosure can be a powerful part of ACT and is con-
sistent with ACT theory: fusion and avoidance are part of the human 
condition, and a counselor is no less susceptible to their power than a 
group member is. A counselor’s self-­disclosure, if done both delicately 
and with an eye toward moving the group process forward, can model 
acceptance, defusion, values, or any other dimension of psychological 
flexibility. In this example, the counselor is saying, in effect, “I struggle 
too. Pursuing a meaningful life does not mean avoiding pain. Just as I 
encourage you to be willing with yours, I try to be willing with mine.”

Empirical Considerations
ACT has been conducted in group format with a variety of problems, 
including problems common to college students such as depression (e.g., 
Zettle and Rains, 1989). ACT has also been studied with college stu-
dents as participants (e.g., Block & Wulfert, 2002). Chapter 3 offers a 
summary of the current state of evidence for ACT. To our knowledge, 
however, the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic ACT group has never 
been studied naturalistically in a CCC. To this end, the first author 
recently completed a pilot study (Boone & Manning, 2012) of a 10-­
session ACT group designed to fit within a single semester (from recruit-
ment to termination) and accommodate any student who struggles with 
depression and/or anxiety.
To prevent disrupting the normal flow of clinical services in a busy 
CCC where research is rarely conducted, students were not required to 
be part of the study in order to join the group, and all participants had 
concurrent treatment at the center (i.e., some combination of individual 
therapy and/or psychiatric medication). Assessments of depression and 
anxiety, quality of life, and psychological flexibility were conducted 
before the group started, halfway through the group, when the group 
ended, and at three-­month follow-­up. There were a total of 18 student 
participants across two semesters, with two dropouts. The data showed 
statistically and clinically significant changes on all measures at termina-
tion, and gains were maintained at follow-­up. Furthermore, students 
rated the group highly on satisfaction surveys, and all students who com-
pleted the group indicated that they would recommend the group to a 
friend. Although these data should be interpreted with caution given 
that there was no control group, the number of participants was small, 
and all students had concurrent treatment, they suggest that transdiag-
nostic ACT groups are acceptable to college students and may be a 
worthwhile intervention for CCCs, especially in light of the growing 
body of outcome data gathered in other settings (Ruiz, 2010).
Final Words
ACT is a good fit for colleges and universities: it is brief, interactive, and 
effective. However, implementing new services in a CCC can be 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
92
challenging, especially in light of limited resources and heightened 
concern on campuses about violence. To address questions about whether 
offering ACT groups is a good use of resources, interested counselors can 
point to ACT’s research base, short-­term format, and broad applicability. 
Counselors can also note the wide availability of low-­cost ACT resources 
(many of which are listed in the Appendix associated with this volume), 
which may cut down on planning time and therefore reduce the poten-
tial clinical hours lost to preparation.
To address concerns about students harming themselves or others, 
counselors can provide education about the ACT model and plan 
thoughtfully for managing risk. ACT-­naïve clinicians and administrators 
sometimes express concern about “accepting thoughts and feelings.” 
They understandably ask if this means all thoughts and feelings, includ-
ing, for example, thoughts of suicide. Prospective group leaders can 
provide assurance that acceptance means letting go of struggle with 
private experiences, not necessarily buying into their content: holding a 
spontaneous suicidal thought compassionately in one’s awareness while 
choosing to act in the service of one’s values is very different from giving 
in to a suicidal thought. Furthermore, ACT groups, like other outpatient 
groups, should have exclusion criteria to rule out the participation of 
students who are at high risk to harm themselves or others. To this end, 
assessment by a professional prior to joining group is essential. To further 
ensure safety, group members can have a counselor assigned to them—
one of the group counselors or the intake counselor—who can provide 
individual support should a crisis arise. Group leaders can also pull stu-
dents aside after groups should especially painful feelings arise during the 
meeting and not be addressed.

nn is a 26-­year-­old PhD student who reports benefiting from 
the MBCT group that she attended. She has a history of depres-
sion and generalized anxiety disorder, and several previous 
treatments with cognitive behavioral therapy. Ann’s struggles with 
anxiety and perfectionism were causing both academic lack of progress 
and problems in her personal relationships. Ann found that the main 
benefit of the course was teaching her how to meditate. Mindfulness 
practice helped her to notice her inner monologue and to respond skill-
fully rather than getting stuck in reactive cycles of deterioration. When 
she now starts to stress and worry she takes a breathing space, sees the 
patterns objectively, and responds to the situation with conscious and 
kind choice. Ann’s scenario is typical of older students with focused 
study requirements and academic anxiety. MBCT appears particularly

effective in bringing about a proactive response versus reactivity, and 
instilling the capacity to switch attention from unhelpful to helpful 
modes of processing thoughts, bodily sensations, and emotions.
Vincent is a 19-­year-­old first year student who lives alone and avoids 
interaction with others. He was diagnosed with depression in high school 
but refused to cooperate with treatment. Recently he reports that he 
cries daily, feels numb and detached, and finds it hard to take in informa-
tion and to produce work. When Vincent began the ACT course he was 
shocked by the level of interaction required but he found the directed 
and fun nature of group exercises less threatening than his previous 
exposure to mental health services. He was impressed by the willingness 
of other students to share, and he found that being taught how to describe 
and interact with his feelings gave him a way to work with, rather than 
hide from, what he was experiencing. He found that “letting go of the 
struggle” had simplified the way he was approaching his studies. He 
started to speak up more in the group and in his lectures. Vincent reports 
that the ACT course helped him “get out of his head.” He was also sur-
prised by how vital he felt when he interacted in the group exercises and 
this boosted his understanding of himself as someone who gets energy 
from connecting with other people and activities. Vincent’s predicament 
is common for younger students who are depressed, have become socially 
withdrawn, and experience their life as lacking direction and 
enjoyment.
This chapter will consider the suitability for college students of two 
mindfulness and acceptance-­based therapies, Mindfulness-­Based 
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams & Teasdale, 2002) and 
Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 
2011). Clinical experiences, and some data, from a controlled trial of 
MBCT and ACT for students experiencing stress, anxiety, and depres-
sion will be presented. The challenges of delivering MBCT and ACT 
with this population will be addressed and recommendations will be 
made for the delivery of these interventions to college students.
A number of recent studies have reported concerning trends in rela-
tion to the psychological health and well-­being of college students. For 
example, American data from the 2010 Cooperative Institutional 
Research Program (CIRP) Freshman survey indicated that first year 
college students’ self-­ratings of their emotional health had dropped to a 
record low level (Pryor, Hurtado, DeAngelo, Blake, & Tran, 2010). Only 

================================================================================

51.9 percent of students reported that their emotional health was in the 
“above average” range. These results represented a drop of 3.4 percent 
from 2009 and a significant decline from the 63.6 percent who placed 
themselves in those categories in 1985.
Furthermore, while students’ perceived emotional health fell, the 
CIRP survey also found that students’ drive to achieve and their percep-
tion of their academic abilities trended upward. More students than ever 
before (71.2 percent) rated their academic abilities as “above average,” 
and 75.8 percent rated their drive to achieve in the same terms. Twenge 
et al. (2010) also examined birth cohort increases in psychopathology 
among young Americans from 1938-­2007 and demonstrated that 
American high school and college students reported significantly more 
symptoms of psychopathology over the generations. In Australia, recent 
college student surveys confirm both high levels of distress (Andrews & 
Chong, 2011) and self-­reported mental health disorders such as depres-
sion, anxiety, and drug and alcohol problems (Vivekananda, Telley, & 
Trethowan, 2011).
Although these high levels of distress may indicate better detection 
of underlying mental health disorders in the community, Twenge et al. 
(2010) also suggest that the reported increases in the mental ill health of 
students result from a cultural shift toward extrinsic values and goals 
such as status and money and away from intrinsic goals such as commu-
nity, meaning of life, and affiliation. This cultural shift may also compro-
mise students’ experience of learning and consequently their mental 
health and well-­being. While positive interactions with faculty and other 
students (in addition to positive family relationships) may contribute to 
students’ development of psychosocial resources and maturity (Adams, 
Berzonsky, & Keating, 2006), in our experience, academic learning can 
be frequently pressured, with little available time to experience engage-
ment or opportunity to interact with peers or instructors. In Australia, 
and in many public universities within the U.S., this situation is exacer-
bated by the need for many students to work part-­time to be financially 
viable. As a result, students’ experience of learning can be one of isola-
tion and striving to master content rather than cultivating intellectual 
curiosity, independence, and critical thinking.
Students stressed by the university context are likely to evaluate 
unwanted feelings as obstacles to academic success and may attempt to 
control unwanted subjective experience by using cognitive and

emotional avoidance strategies such as rumination, worry, perfectionism, 
procrastination, eating dysregulation, drug and alcohol misuse, and self-­
harm. However, as noted in other chapters in this book (see chapter 3), 
experiential avoidance strategies are both ineffectual and have rebound 
effects: Attempts to inhibit unpleasant experiences both increase the fre-
quency and distress of these experiences (Gross, 2002) and the sense of 
being disconnected from oneself (John & Gross, 2004). Students looking 
for assistance may often have expectations for “quick fixes” that will 
remove 
uncomfortable 
feelings 
and 
improve 
their 
academic 
functioning.
The Potential of Acceptance-­Based 
Therapies on Campus
In contrast to the common assumption that internal discomfort has to 
be eliminated in order to improve functioning, mindfulness and 
acceptance-­based therapies such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
Therapy (MBCT; Segal et al., 2002) and Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 2011) suggest that functioning can be 
improved by changing the way people perceive and interact with their 
internal experiences rather than changing the experiences themselves. 
Acceptance-­based interventions attempt to develop this perspective by 
providing “discovery” learning to students, in which they engage with 
experiential exercises and have the opportunity to reflect on what is 
meaningful for them. This explicit values dimension may be relevant for 
students who are developmentally at a stage of self-­discovery and clarifi-
cation about personal values. Students may be vulnerable to overidenti-
fication with extrinsic cultural values that may not deliver stable per-
sonal satisfaction. However, if students are aware of personal values and 
engage in balanced activities in areas covering love, work, play, and 
health, this expands opportunities for meaning and self-­discovery. With 
a flexible and focused sense of awareness around personal meaning, the 
vicissitudes of academic stress and unpleasant experiences may be better 
managed.

Mindfulness-­Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT)
MBCT integrates the practice of mindfulness meditation, using the 
structure of insight-­oriented meditation drawn from Mindfulness-­Based 
Stress Reduction (Kabat-­Zinn, 1990), with principles of cognitive therapy 
(Segal et al., 2002). It is a small-group program (up to 12 participants) 
across eight weeks. This program was initially developed for the treat-
ment of recurrent depression, and it aims to interrupt the ruminative 
habits that fuel depressive relapse. The MBCT program uses intensive 
meditation practice to train the ability to “decenter” or “step back from” 
the content of current experience and to strengthen discernment regard-
ing self-­care.
Mindfulness is often described as paying attention on purpose, in 
the present moment, and nonjudgmentally (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). A key 
component of MBCT and MBSR (see chapter 6) is inquiry (Segal et al., 
2002). Learning emerges from an investigative process that follows the 
practice, through a dialogue between the student and teacher, rather 
than being introduced in a didactic way. The intention of this investiga-
tive process is to “draw out whatever participants noticed during the 
practice and by doing this encourage them to reflect on and explore their 
experience, work together through dialogue about these observations to 
find out what is being discovered, and link these observations to the 
aims of the program” (Crane, 2009, p. 141).
MBCT draws a distinction between two modes of mind: “doing 
mode” and “being mode.” The “doing mode” pertains to the goal-­
oriented actions where we are striving toward what we want or away 
from what we don’t want (Crane, 2009). The “being mode” is character-
ized by an intentional placement of attention on the present moment and 
direct contact with the world through one’s senses (Crane, 2009). The 
goal in MBCT is to increasingly cultivate the “being mode” through 
mindfulness meditation.
These and additional aspects of MBCT will be discussed below when 
addressing modifications made to adjust to a college student 
population.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(ACT)
The theory and practical application of ACT is described in detail in 
other chapters of this book (see chapters 3 and 4). Principles of behavior 
change are central to ACT, and this intervention accesses a wide range 
of techniques to further these aims. It uses metaphors, logical paradoxes, 
and experiential exercises to foster the six theoretical processes of defu-
sion, acceptance, present moment awareness, self as context, values clar-
ification, and committed action.
Some Similarities/Differences between 
MBCT and ACT
A thorough comparison of these two approaches is beyond the scope 
of this chapter, but we will outline a few similarities and differences 
between MBCT and ACT, particularly as pertaining to mindfulness. 
MBCT and ACT both utilize experiential exercises in order to help indi-
viduals become aware of automatic patterns of expectations and reac-
tions and promote investigation of the “workability” of coping behaviors. 
They train acceptance of uncomfortable experiences, with an emphasis 
on moving forward with discomfort, by creating a different relationship 
with difficult experiences based on acceptance and equanimity (MBCT) 
or by maintaining a perspective on life’s bigger meaning and purpose 
(ACT). Both therapies promote psychological flexibility and the viewing 
of thoughts as merely verbal events rather than actual events. An 
increased internal locus of control and sense of agency are common by-­
products of acceptance-­based learning (McCarthy, 2011).
Both therapies incorporate mindfulness. The elements of mindful-
ness (i.e., present awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance) that are a 
foundation of acceptance-­based therapies are also antidotes against the 
habitual inflexible modes of functioning—­hurry, worry, and evaluation. 
Mindfulness trains attention to be flexible and focuses on enabling adap-
tive working with thoughts, bodily sensations, and emotions (Denton & 
Sears, 2009). Mindfulness has consistently been associated with increased 

================================================================================
MBCT and ACT at University of Sydney
101
subjective well-­being, reduced emotional reactivity, and improved behav-
ioral regulation (see review by Keng, Smoski, & Robins, 2011).
The way mindfulness is presented in these two therapies, as well as 
other mindfulness approaches, varies greatly. MBCT, an intensive mind-
fulness program, utilizes systematic meditation practices to develop 
mindfulness skills experientially. Outside of meditation times, attention 
is drawn to mindless reactivity and to the generalization of formal prac-
tices to everyday activities of living. MBCT aims to cultivate decentered 
awareness, to disidentify from the contents of one’s consciousness (i.e., 
one’s thoughts, emotions) and to view moment-­to-­moment experience 
with greater clarity and objectivity (Shapiro, Carlson, Astin, & Freedman, 
2006). Through daily meditation practice, the ability to “step back from” 
the content of current experience is developed, and discernment regard-
ing self-­care is a natural by-product of this awareness.
ACT mindfulness exercises combine aspects of acceptance, defu-
sion, self as context (awareness that one is more than one’s thoughts, 
feelings, and experiences), and contact with the present moment 
(Strosahl, Hayes, Wilson, & Gifford, 2004). Formal mindfulness medita-
tion practice may or may not be included in ACT protocols, and the 
duration of in-­session mindfulness practices tends to be shorter than in 
MBCT. Furthermore, aspects of guided visualization are often mixed 
with mindfulness instructions (e.g., the Leaves On a Stream exercise, 
Hayes, Smith, 2005). These differences in the dose and the type of mind-
fulness training across approaches may lead to different outcomes 
(Carmody & Baer, 2008).
MBCT and ACT for College Students 
at University of Sydney
We have recently conducted a study offering MBCT and ACT 
groups for college students at Sydney University Counseling and 
Psychological Services (Foley & Renner, 2012). Reflecting the con-
straints of the university timetable, protocols for six-­week groups with 
weekly two-­hour sessions were developed for both the MBCT and ACT 
conditions and included their central components. Protocols targeted 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
102
stress, anxiety, and depression, and the group format aimed to increase a 
sense of connectedness and to emphasize common experience. There 
were two therapists and 8 to 16 student participants per group. A brief 
description of the empirical findings from this study will be presented 
later, after outlining the session content for each approach and describ-
ing some unique MBCT and ACT interventions used with college 
students.
EXAMPLES OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF MBCT 
AND ACT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS
Protocols primarily relied on existing materials for both MBCT 
(Segal et al., 2002) and ACT (Harris, 2009; Hayes et al., 2011). However, 
several modifications were made to fit college students and/or the campus 
context. In-­session and home meditations for the MBCT program were 
shortened and ranged from 3 minutes to 20 minutes. Sessions 2 & 3 and 
4 & 7 of the traditional MBCT program were collapsed into one session 
each. MBCT sessions included meditation, inquiry, and some didactic 
material guided by the content of the original manual, with modifica-
tions to address the context (i.e., developmental stage of participants, 
university environment). See Table 1 for an outline of the session proto-
cols. The MBCT intervention was more introverted in nature than the 
ACT program, with meditations and subsequent inquiry about student 
experience of these meditations being the central teaching tool. The 
importance of practicing meditation at home was particularly empha-
sized in the MBCT condition, although both conditions received the 
same CD with recordings of mindfulness meditations of 3 minutes to 30 
minutes in duration. The sessions in the ACT condition had similar 
weekly themes as the MBCT condition; however, there was less emphasis 
on mindfulness practice. There was greater use of metaphors and inter-
active group experiences for those in the ACT group. The ACT condi-
tion also had explicit values work. Weekly handouts summarized the 
content of sessions and provided space to document details of home 
practice.
In the MBCT condition, the process of inquiry described above was 
facilitated by a diagram (see Figure 1 below) that was placed on the floor, 
in the center of the circle of students:

Figure 1. Floor Diagram to Facilitate Inquiry in MBCT
When students were describing their experience of home tasks, in-­
session exercises, or current experience, they would use this structure to 
do so. They would often literally walk around the diagram as they 
explained their experience: “When I first came in today, I was all in my 
head, worrying about all the things that I need to get done today” (stand-
ing on the “thoughts” card), “and then I started to notice just how tense 
I was in my body” (moving one foot to the “physical sensations” card), 
“and then, toward the end of the meditation, I could sometimes be still 
for a few moments” (the student stepped into the center of the diagram 
and moved her weight between this space and the “thoughts” card). Over 
time, we found that students used the diagram as a structure to notice 
their current mode, to direct their attention toward their physical sensa-
tions, and to achieve a “decentered” awareness. They became familiar 
with their automatic habits and could explain these using the diagram 
(e.g., “I am always in my head,” “I don’t tend to be aware of my body,” or 
“I just take off and distract myself and then I start thinking about it and 
feel bad”).
In the ACT condition, we also emphasized working externally with 
internal processes to combat the tendency toward intellectualization, to 
ease social anxiety, and to promote interaction. For example, in ACT 
students were asked to use play dough to create an external representa-
tion of the issue with which they struggled. After participants finished, 
they were required to describe, but not explain, their creation. For 
instance, one student described his “pain” as a ball with spikes all over it 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
104
and another student described it as “a large flat object that is thin and 
stretched at some edges and curling over itself on others.” Figure 2 below 
shows pictures of these two examples.
Figure 2. Play Dough Depiction of “Internal Pain” by Students 
in the ACT Condition
The students were then invited to stand with their creation. It was 
acknowledged that everyone differed and tended to interact with experi-
ence in different ways. Students were also invited to “strike a pose” that 
represented how they interacted with their struggle. Students engaged 
well with this task and “poses” included putting objects on heads, hiding 
them behind themselves, throwing them across the room, and curling up 
in a ball next to them. Rather than using such reactive experiential 
avoidance strategies of avoiding, altering, or controlling, the group then 
experimented with how to remain in contact with negative experiences 
and respond based on mindfulness, acceptance, and values.

ACT Exercises,” at www.newharbinger.com/2225.

Empirical Considerations
A recent meta-­analytic review of intensive mindfulness-­based programs 
revealed medium to large effect sizes for improvements in anxiety and 
depression (Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010). Both MBCT and 
ACT are evidence-­based approaches. MBCT has received strong empiri-
cal support in the treatment of individuals with recurrent depression 

================================================================================
MBCT and ACT at University of Sydney
109
(Ma & Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale et al., 2000) and has more recently been 
used for the treatment of a variety of psychological experiences including 
suicide ideation, anxiety, and health-related distress (e.g., Chiesa & 
Serretti, 2011; Foley, Baillie, Huxter, Price, & Sinclair, 2010). Similarly, 
ACT has obtained medium to large effect sizes across a variety of presen-
tations (Ruiz, 2010; see chapter 3 for more detail).
As noted in chapter 1, this field is extending into college campuses: 
There is growing conceptual and empirical evidence for the inclusion of 
mindfulness in interventions promoting the well-­being of college stu-
dents. Frewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, & Partridge (2008) reported that 
among undergraduate students, higher mindfulness was related both to a 
lower frequency of negative automatic thoughts and to an enhanced 
ability to let go of those thoughts. In a randomized control trial, Oman, 
Shapiro, Thoresen, Plante, & Flinders (2008) found that participation in 
MBSR was associated with decreased stress and enhanced forgiveness 
among college students. Furthermore, in a recent study of MBCT for 
students, participation was associated with a reduction in negative affect 
and an increase in mindfulness, and these variables were significantly 
negatively correlated (Collard, Avny, & Boniwell, 2008). ACT has been 
used with college students as well with promising findings (see chapter 
4).
As mindfulness-­based approaches proliferate, the question of how 
they perform with different populations, such as college students, and 
relative to one another, becomes more salient—­hence the authors’ deci-
sion to conduct a study comparing MBCT and ACT with college stu-
dents; 246 students had indicated an interest in the groups, but only 136 
attended the first session and are thus considered to be study partici-
pants. MBCT and ACT packages were offered in randomized order, with 
students allocated to the next available group. The majority of partici-
pants were female (MBCT 67% and ACT 76%) and single (MBCT 83% 
and ACT 81%). The average participant was 26 years old and in his or 
her third year of study. Students were most commonly studying the arts, 
followed by science and business. There were no condition differences in 
these factors at baseline.
Levels of psychological distress, quality of life, mindfulness, and psy-
chological flexibility were assessed before and after the treatment. There 
was a large attrition of students across the study (31%), a problem com-
monly reported by researchers working with this population (e.g., Forman 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
110
et al., 2007 reported 43.5% attrition in a similar sample). Non-­attendance 
tended to be common as finals approached. There was no significant dif-
ference between conditions in treatment dropout. However, dropouts 
across both conditions tended to have higher distress at initial assess-
ment than completers.
College students completing either the MBCT or ACT course 
reported a significant decrease in psychological distress—­a change of 
moderate to large magnitude (effect sizes 0.48-­0.96)—­and large increases 
in mindfulness and acceptance (effect sizes 0.71-­1.49). There was no sig-
nificant statistical difference between groups on these treatment gains. 
However, there was a non-­significant trend for the MBCT condition 
being associated with greater reductions in anxiety. Results indicated 
that the only personality trait of students to interact with group alloca-
tion in contributing to treatment gains was openness, which was associ-
ated with greater gains in terms of anxiety reduction across groups. There 
was a trend for students who rated highly on both openness and anxiety 
to do better when allocated to the MBCT group. While there were no 
significant differences between MBCT and ACT, we made observations 
along the way that may be helpful to the field and guide future research.
Overall Facilitator Observations
A number of key observations across both conditions were made 
about the ways students engaged with the material. There was a strong 
tendency for intellectualizing in the early stage of the courses as students 
resisted the expectation for experiential learning (e.g., “I hoped someone 
would tell me what to do”). Students also tended to slip into a passive 
“lecture mode” at times, so the facilitators “knocked” the groups out of 
this “autopilot” repeatedly. We also found that concepts needed to be 
repeated several times and across sessions for students to integrate them. 
Finally, students tended to hear “distraction” when we were explaining 
mindfulness, and required a lot of support in understanding the distinc-
tion between mindfulness and distraction.
In the MBCT condition, students reported low levels of home prac-
tice and some struggled to connect with their current experience during 
in-­session meditations. This meant that periods of inquiry were limited. 
The energy levels in MBCT groups were also lower than in the ACT 

================================================================================
MBCT and ACT at University of Sydney
111
groups. However, despite the low participation at times, MBCT students 
reported that they “were getting a lot out of it” and seemed to assimilate 
the ideas by the end of the course.
The ACT program seemed to be better received by less-motivated 
college students over the MBCT program, given the interactive nature of 
groups and the more relaxed requirements for meditation practice. 
However, the non-­significant trend for MBCT in anxiety reduction may 
indicate that students with anxiety may have an enhanced response to 
the extended mindfulness practices. Encouraging “being” versus “doing 
mode” of mind seemed to provide an effective decentering perspective 
for anxious students.
Values Clarification
Although the impact of values was not assessed quantitatively, values 
work raises challenges for this age group and context. Students who 
overidentify with expectations of competitive academic achievement 
may readily understand values as goals to be attained rather than guiding 
principles for doing what matters in the present, so the nuances of how 
this is presented need to be carefully considered. Sheldon and Kasser 
(2001) suggest that as people grow older, they may be better able to orient 
toward issues that will satisfy their deeper psychological needs and less 
interested in short-term, superficial, or materialistic issues. Conversely, in 
line with the concept of “zone of proximal development” (Vygotsky, 
1978), presenting the opportunity to interact with values thinking may 
itself prompt increased capacity for values exploration.
Our observation was that the MBCT group, which focused on shifts 
in modes of processing and reflections on lifestyle (e.g., noticing nourish-
ing and depleting activities) rather than explicit reference to values, 
often resulted in students spontaneously bringing up personal life mean-
ings. This is consistent with the finding that MBCT may assist partici-
pants in clarifying their important goals and increasing their confidence 
in their capacity to move in valued life directions (Crane, Winder, 
Hargus, Amarasinghe, & Barnhofer, 2011). For anxious and stressed stu-
dents, values work may tip them into a “doing” mode of mind and they 
may get overwhelmed with the apparent discrepancy between living a 
valued life and their current status; conversely depressed students may 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
112
have difficulty engaging values work due to mood, or the perceived pres-
sure of purpose and motivation. In summary, it is our impression that the 
identification of life values is challenging with this population. In line 
with this hypothesis, Forman et al. (2007) did not identify values as a 
significant factor mediating clinical improvements in their ACT courses 
for students. This issue of the staging and impact of values work across 
various clinical issues and ages requires further investigation.
Mindfulness
The core process and discipline of regular mindful practice may at 
times be too abstract for students to integrate and apply, both in terms of 
their limited life experience and in terms of what fits their lifestyle 
choices. To enhance its workability, MBCT may benefit from being pre-
sented within a motivational frame (e.g., by exploring the costs and ben-
efits of mindfulness practice) in order to promote engagement (Bricker & 
Tollison, 2011). These aspects, in addition to the intensive training in 
mindfulness required of trainers, may represent shortcomings in MBCT 
as a first-line approach with college students at counseling centers.
In ACT, mindfulness is only one element of the training, which also 
involves highly interactive exercises that seem to be energizing and 
promote connection with the self and with others. These briefer exer-
cises may allow participants to be able to have “islands” of mindfulness 
within their college life, as research suggests that even brief doses of 
mindfulness result in improved functioning (Erisman & Roemer, 2010). 
In college contexts, the lighter dose of mindfulness offered in ACT may 
be suitable given student constraints in time and motivation.
Conversely, the potential of mindfulness may not be fully developed 
when it is used as a “means to an end” rather than using the practice in 
its more formal way to develop an awareness of impermanence, the pat-
terns of human suffering, and the importance of nonjudgmental accep-
tance as a pathway out of suffering (“being mode”). Exposure to in-­session 
doses of experiential acceptance may be particularly useful for students 
in enhancing friendly awareness linked to wise personal care (i.e., “being” 
before “doing”). The danger of the smaller dose mindfulness (especially 
when combined with visualization) is that it may be used simply as a 
distraction or an escape and may contribute to the creation of “successful 

================================================================================

(mind-­less) strivers.” For example, as a student becomes busy and frag-
mented he may use “mindfulness” to decrease his sense of fragmentation 
and with the intention of becoming better at being busy. There is some 
danger that such exercises can inadvertently function as avoidance. 
Regardless of the specific methods used, clinicians need to inquire how 
the students are using mindfulness techniques to ensure they are not 
absorbed into old patterns of avoidance.
Mindful approaches may be of most benefit in times of acute stress—­
when difficult things are happening emotionally or physically. A gentle, 
non-­reactive awareness can enable stepping back from the eye of the 
storm, allowing a place to view experience from and prompting aware-
ness that experience is not permanent or self-­defining, that it will shift 
and change. This is different from mere distraction. While distraction 
techniques can be effective when intrusions are short lived, mindfulness 
is a more effective approach with more chronic issues (Kabat-­Zinn, 2002). 
Similarly, while relaxation can reduce distress, mindfulness meditation 
does a better job of inducing positive states of mind and reducing rumi-
native thoughts and behaviors (Jain et al., 2007).
The more intensive mindfulness training included in programs such 
as MBCT is not goal directed, it is spacious and aims for a continuity of 
practice. The intention is to move toward living mindfully with occa-
sional moments of non-­mindful living/reactivity. The confusion about 
mindfulness training in the literature and in practice may be a conse-
quence of fusion with the dialectic of Western society—­the striving to 
improve functioning and the desire to feel whole and connected. For 
example, the mixing of mindfulness instructions with guided imagery 
may not be useful as the intention of mindfulness is to provide a space for 
participants to become connected with the current experience and to 
reduce clinging to their experience being a particular way. The trainer 
needs to be explicit about the intention of the exercise and the instruc-
tions provided to students to ensure that mindfulness is not confused 
with distraction and/or thought control (Fisher & Wells, 2009). We 
agree with the recommendation from Keng et al. (2011) that future work 
should examine who mindfulness training is most effective for and under 
what conditions, given that there is a suggestion that its effectiveness can 
vary according to individual differences (Cordon, Brown, & Gibson, 
2009).

Final Words
Acceptance-­based approaches seem fitting to the college context, given 
students’ common overidentification with cultural expectations around 
success and distress, and their possible lack of capacity to decenter from 
the content of current experience. The college environment, which is 
often characterized by intellectualization and a pressure to perform, can 
further restrict the developmental process of exploration and self-­
discovery. Both the MBCT and ACT approaches facilitate self-­awareness 
through direct contact with experience and encourage participants to 
step back from the “control and elimination agenda” of human suffering 
to promote the value of living an engaged and meaningful life. These 
therapies offer explicit experiential training in adaptive self-­regulation 
facilitating psychosocial development and growth. Vygotsky (1978) wrote 
about “the zone of proximal development,” which refers to the level of 
understanding that a student can reach with a teacher’s help. Scaffolding 
instruction as a teaching strategy provides support to facilitate learner 
development. From this psychology of learning perspective, both 
approaches are engaging and effective.
Our research suggests that both MBCT and ACT work to reduce 
distress and promote important elements of psychological flexibility 
(mindfulness and acceptance). Although the measured outcomes were 
comparable across conditions in our study, the way students interacted 
with the programs seemed to differ. Our clinical experience suggests that 
ACT may be the more pragmatic intervention for traditional-­age stu-
dents, like Vincent at the beginning of the chapter, who are limited in 
time and motivation, given that ACT’s range of behavior change tech-
niques allows for more active engagement with self and others. Conversely, 
motivated older students struggling with more chronic problems, like 
Ann at the beginning of the chapter, may gain more from MBCT.

avid walked into the college counseling center (CCC) com-
plaining that he can’t sleep and that this is leading to consider-
able anxiety regarding his ability to do his academic work. He 
claims to be exhausted most of the time, has little motivation to study, 
and when he does study, he reports an inability to concentrate. He says 
he is spending a great deal of time on the web, e-­mailing, and texting. 
Additionally, he told the counselor that he feels anxious for no reason 
most of the time and “sort of” depressed.
Liza was referred to the CCC by Tutoring. She says that recently her 
test anxiety has gotten so bad that she either “blanks out” when she is 
taking a test or is so anxious that she is unable to study.
Both of these students were referred to the center’s Mindfulness-­
Based Stress Reduction group and illustrate some presenting issues that 
can be addressed in this type of group.

Mindfulness Meditation as a 
Treatment Modality: Background
Over the past thirty years, there has been a rapidly increasing body of 
literature demonstrating the effectiveness of meditation on physical and 
psychological health (e.g., Hoffman, Sawyer, Witt, and Oh, 2010). 
Mindfulness meditation, a specific form of meditation, has been shown 
to be particularly promising (e.g., Kabat-­Zinn, 1984, 1990, 2003; Kabat-­
Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, & Sellers, 1987; Khalsa and Stauth, 2002).
Mindfulness meditation is a simple yet profound practice. Although 
there are many different schools of thought and practice in terms of 
mindfulness, Kabat-­Zinn has defined mindfulness as “the awareness that 
emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, 
and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment-­to-­moment” 
(Kabat-­Zinn, 2003, p. 145). It is based on the premise of cultivating a 
mind-­state that is focused in the present moment in a nonjudgmental 
way (Kabat-­Zinn, 1990). In the beginning of mindfulness meditation, 
people are taught to focus on the rising and falling of their breath, and to 
bring their attention back to the breath anytime they notice that their 
mind has wandered. After some time with this practice, the focus of 
meditation widens to include awareness of sound, smell, touch, and 
movement. Later the focus expands to include awareness of all that is 
happening in the present moment. In this way, people learn to focus on 
what is happening now rather than worrying about what happened in 
the past or what will/might happen in the future. Being fully present in 
each moment in a nonjudgmental way, accepting what is, is the focus of 
the practice. Ultimately, the practice of mindfulness allows us to interact 
with the world in a more balanced, efficient and aware manner.
8-­Week MBSR Group at a CCC
This chapter describes a mindfulness meditation group program at the 
University of Florida Counseling Center that treats students dealing pri-
marily with anxiety-­related, but also other, issues. The group, described 

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
121
below in detail, is based on the MBSR program developed by Dr. Jon 
Kabat-­Zinn (1990). The group, advertised to college students as “Taming 
Your Anxious Mind,” was initiated twelve years ago and has run every 
semester since it was first offered (Murphy, 2006). Its popularity has 
soared. Whereas in the beginning we had to vigorously advertise and 
recruit group members, now we have to offer multiple groups per semes-
ter and they fill quickly and easily via within-­center clinician referrals. 
The group meets for 1.5 hours every week for eight consecutive weeks. 
Students are referred to the group by CCC clinicians or self-­referred from 
group advertisements on the CCC’s website or in the university newspa-
per. Group size hovers around 10-­12 students per group.
Pre-­Group Considerations
The group is run in a group therapy room at our CCC. There are no 
special needs facility-­wise for this group: The space does not need to be 
especially quiet or soundproof; nor does it need to be away from center 
traffic. Learning to meditate amidst the “distractions” of life is essential 
to the effectiveness of this training, and therefore, welcomed rather than 
avoided.
SCREENING INTERVIEW
Each student who is referred to the group goes through an individual 
pre-­group screening interview with one of the group leaders. In the early 
years of the group, this pre-­group screening session was not always con-
ducted, but after analyzing group dropout patterns we decided to require 
the screening in order to select more appropriate members, screen out 
inappropriate members, and prepare the student for the group. This 
practice has resulted in dramatically decreased dropout rates and 
improved treatment outcomes. We now strongly recommend this facet of 
the program.
Each screening interview lasts thirty minutes. In the interview, we 
assess whether the client’s psychological issue is appropriate for this treat-
ment modality and make referrals if that is not the case. We often have 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
122
clients who are in both individual counseling and the group (e.g., eating 
disorder, sexual abuse, panic disorders, and so on). We also assess for 
degree of disturbance in order to avoid enrolling students who might 
require more time than the group can provide (e.g., students who are in 
crisis or suicidal). The mindfulness group is not a “counseling” group, but 
rather a “skills” group; hence we do not spend time in the group talking 
about individual psychological issues. If a client needs that individual 
time, we use individual counseling to complement the group treatment. 
We also carefully assess for any contraindications for meditation 
practice—­e.g., someone who tends to dissociate—­and we refer this 
student to a more appropriate treatment modality. Most importantly, we 
assess potential group members’ motivation for the group: their openness 
to the idea of mindfulness meditation, their willingness to attend each 
and every group session, and their willingness to practice the meditation 
techniques daily. If a student cannot commit to attending each and every 
session and to practicing the meditation techniques every day, we screen 
that person out of the group, telling her that she can be in the group in a 
later semester when she can commit to these two requirements. Though 
it is tempting for group leaders to not have such stringent screening 
requirements, we have found that enforcing these requirements has dra-
matically reduced dropout rates and increased the chances that members 
will experience positive gains from the group. In the pre-­group screening 
interview, we also educate clients about the format and content of the 
group and how it can be appropriate for their psychological issues. In 
essence, once we determine that the person is appropriate for the group, 
we begin “treatment” even during the screening process. This prepares 
them for the group meetings. We have found that most any psychological 
issue can be treated effectively in this group, either by group treatment 
alone or by the combination of group and individual treatment. 
Communication between individual and group counselors is important 
to enhance treatment outcomes.
If, during the course of the group, we find that a client is not appro-
priate (e.g., a trauma survivor who experiences intense flashbacks during 
meditation), we will meet with this member and make the appropriate 
referral to individual counseling. With careful screening, the occurrence 
of such an event is rare. However, it does occur occasionally, and group 
leaders should be prepared to recognize the problem and deal with it 
immediately.

================================================================================

GROUP FACILITATORS
Who can lead a mindfulness meditation group? In our experience we 
have found that unless the leader (1) has been trained in mindfulness 
meditation, and (2) is actively practicing mindfulness meditation in her 
own life, she will not be an effective leader for this group. Hence at our 
center we require leaders to meet these two requirements. With center 
clinicians or trainees at our center (practicum students or interns) who 
want to learn how to lead this type of group, we use an apprenticeship 
model. We ask that they first experience the group as a member (for one 
semester), and then move into a “junior co-­leader” role the second semes-
ter. We also require that they develop their own daily meditation prac-
tice. After they have satisfied these three requirements, they are then 
“qualified” to lead a mindfulness-­based group. Though this training is 
rather extensive, we have found that it leads to more effective leaders.
Session Content
The following is a description of the content of the weekly sessions.
Session 1
In session 1, the leader introduces herself and then asks members to 
introduce themselves. In introducing themselves, group members are 
asked to say their name, what they are studying, and a few words about 
the psychological issue that has caused them to join the group. We do 
not encourage them to go into detail about their reason for joining, but 
we do comment on how the members can benefit from the group in rela-
tion to their presenting issues. We also “build bridges” between students 
by commenting on how different members have similar presenting issues 
and how mindfulness meditation can be effective in addressing these 
particular issues. We discuss with the group that this is not a “counsel-
ing” group but rather a skill-­based group and that we will not use group 
time to delve into their specific personal/life issues, explaining that 
delving into these issues reduces needed time to learn the mindfulness 
skills. We have also found that the skills themselves often address 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
124
psychological issues, without having to ever get into the actual content. 
This, in fact, is a hallmark of mindfulness training—that it focuses on 
how the mind works rather than on what we think about. We remind 
students that we will refer them to individual counseling (in addition to 
the group) if that seems to be appropriate.
The format of the group is then discussed, with the leader reinforc-
ing that this is an 8-­week commitment and that members must (1) attend 
each and every session, and (2) practice the meditation techniques every 
day. We have found that this commitment is perhaps the most important 
factor in determining success for group members; hence we stress it at the 
pre-­group screening interview, as discussed above, and in each and every 
group meeting.
All members are given a workbook which includes (1) home practice 
assignments for the week related to what was taught in that week’s 
meeting, (2) a short (1-­2 page) informative/inspirational reading which 
they are to read prior to meditating each day—taken from various medi-
tation books, (3) an overview of the 8-­session group, (4) a log form to 
record the time and place of their home meditation practice, (5) a form 
to record their reactions to each home practice session, and (6) a journal 
entry form where they are to reflect on how their meditation practice 
went each week.
Members are then led in the traditional “Eating a Raisin” exercise, 
in which the principles of mindfulness meditation (e.g., paying attention 
to small details of taste, smell, texture) are experienced in the eating of a 
raisin. This is followed by a ten-­minute mindfulness meditation exercise 
where members focus on the rising and falling of their breath, and are 
instructed to bring their attention back to the breath each time they 
notice that their minds have wandered off of the breath. We then process 
their reactions to these exercises and give an explanation of what mind-
fulness meditation is and is not. For example, when doing mindfulness 
meditation, we tell them that in mindfulness meditation it is common 
and normal for the mind to wander and be distracted. Members often see 
this wandering as proof that they are doing it “wrong.” We remind them 
that with mindfulness meditation the purpose is not to have a mind that 
never wanders, but rather to be able to recognize when the mind wanders 
and then bring it back to the present moment. We also emphasize that 
we initially focus on bringing our attention back to the breath because 
the breath is a tether line to the present moment. We also emphasize that 

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
125
mindfulness meditation is not about “blissing out” and “feeling good”; 
rather, it is about living in the present moment and experiencing the 
present moment with increasing clarity and vividness.
The first session ends with (1) a description of the 8-­week program, 
(2) a discussion of the format of the group, and (3) handing out and 
explaining the “home practice” for the week. The home practice for the 
first week includes: (1) doing a 5-­minute sitting meditation practice 
session each and every day, (2) recording time, place and reaction to each 
session, (3) eating one “mindful meal” where the focus of the meal is on 
the present moment of each bite—and noticing when their mind has 
wandered and bringing the attention back to the eating, and (4) stopping 
and doing a 30-­second “mindfulness break” once or twice each day—
where the student stops whatever she is doing, closes her eyes, and focuses 
on her breathing for 30 seconds.
Sessions 2 through 8, described below, have basically the same 
general format: (1) each session begins with a practice of the meditation 
technique assigned as homework the previous week, (2) a processing of 
the home practice—which includes the leaders using members’ experi-
ences and reactions as a way to teach the principles of what mindfulness 
meditation is and how it works, (3) an exercise to teach a mindfulness 
principle (e.g., why we focus on the breath when we meditate) or mind-
fulness technique (e.g., walking meditation), (4) another period of mind-
fulness meditation practice, and (5) going over the home practice for 
that week.
What follows are some specific topics and exercises/practices that 
are incorporated into sessions 2 through 8:
Session Two
1.	 Conduct opening exercise: Conduct body scan meditation 
(15-­30 minutes) focusing on sensations in the body rather than 
bringing the attention back to the breath. In this exercise, stu-
dents close their eyes and then focus on different parts of the 
body (e.g., stomach, jaw, foot). While focusing on the body part, 
they are asked to pay very close attention to any sensations that 
they feel in that body part (e.g., hot/cold, tingling, tightness). 
They are instructed to not try to change the sensation, but simply 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
126
to “accept” it and to observe it with curiosity and close atten-
tion. The emphasis on the body gives members another concrete 
element to focus on that will bring them back to the present 
moment. It also serves to emphasize “acceptance”—­accepting 
whatever sensation you are having in that part of your body 
without trying to change it. This acceptance is a core principle 
of mindfulness meditation.
2.	 Review and process homework: Time is taken in this session to 
reiterate that there are no “failures” in meditation (e.g., your 
mind wandering) and that “success” comes from simply per-
forming the meditation each day.
3.	 Teach a principle of the day: the importance of the breath in 
meditation (as previously described).
4.	 Conduct a mid-­session exercise: e.g., a 5 to 10 minute period of 
sitting/breath meditation.
5.	 Answer questions about meditation, home practice, and so on.
6.	 Assign home practice for the week: (1) Do the body scan medi-
tation every other day, alternating with sitting/breath medita-
tion; (2) do sitting meditation every other day, alternating with 
body scan meditation; (3) do a 30-­second “mindfulness break” 
two times each day; (4) be mindful when doing one “routine” 
activity (e.g., brushing teeth); and (5) record the time and place 
of each daily meditation session, reactions to each session, and 
reflections on this week’s meditation practice. During this first 
discussion of home practice, we emphasize that finding a place to 
meditate often presents some obstacles for college students given 
that some roommates may be noisy and/or intrusive. We suggest 
finding a comfortable place to meditate and going to that same 
place each time they meditate. We also emphasize trying to 
develop a regular time to meditate. Both of these patterns rein-
force the practice and make it more likely that students will 
actually do the meditation. Likewise, we emphasize that it is not 
necessary to have a completely quiet place in order to meditate. 
We discuss how to deal with distractions (e.g., phone ringing, 
roommate playing music, sounds down the hall) by making 

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
127
these distractions part of the meditation practice (e.g., “notice 
the phone ringing and then come back to your breath”). This 
approach begins to teach the concept that anywhere or anytime 
can be an opportunity to practice meditation and that one 
doesn’t need “special circumstances” to do mindfulness 
meditation.
Session 3
1.	 Review/process home practice: Discuss challenges with medita-
tion practice (e.g., where to practice, noise) and reinforce “just 
doing it” (rather than requiring it to be a “good/successful” 
meditation).
2.	 Conduct opening exercise: Lead group in body scan meditation 
(20-­30 minutes), emphasizing attention to body awareness and 
using the body (instead of the breath) as the “tether line to the 
present moment.”
3.	 Introduce new mindfulness concepts (during processing/review-
ing of home practice): “being” vs. “doing”; the need to “be pro-
ductive” and do multiple tasks, and how these are obstacles to 
being in the present moment. David, the student we introduced 
at the beginning of the chapter, for example, struggled with this 
issue, feeling pulled to multi-­tasking instead of focusing on just 
one thing. The following is an excerpt from a group interaction 
between the facilitator and David:
Counselor:	
David, what is it like to focus on just one thing, for 
example the breath, and to not let your mind just wander 
all over the place?
David:	
It’s hard. My mind seems to just wander all the time, like 
I’m in class and I start thinking about what I’m going to 
post on Facebook, and it seems impossible to keep it 
focused on one thing, like what the teacher is saying.

Counselor:	
I know it’s hard…very hard. This is not a skill that you 
will learn overnight. It’s a skill that you need to practice 
daily, like lifting weights or working out. Or like learning 
to play the piano. The more you practice or “work out,” 
the better you get. But it doesn’t happen all at once. The 
learning is incremental, almost not noticeable at first. 
But, in fact, you are developing the skill to focus each and 
every time you notice that your mind has wandered and 
you bring it back to the breath, the present moment. 
Noticing the breath is a way to practice the skill, but you 
can use that same skill to be present in your classes, when 
listening to your girlfriend, or when studying for a test.
4.	 Lead exercise: sitting meditation (10 minutes).
5.	 Assign and discuss home practice: (1) Meditate daily for 5-­10 
minutes alternating focus on breath and focus on body; (2) 
experiment with “mindful driving” (of car or bike); (3) experi-
ment with walking from one class to another while practicing 
mindfulness and being in the present moment.
Session 4
1.	 Lead sitting meditation exercise (10 minutes)
2.	 Review and process home practice while emphasizing and rein-
forcing mindfulness concepts.
3.	 Introduce new mindfulness concept (during home practice dis-
cussion): the importance of “not judging” in cultivating mind-
fulness, happiness, and contentment. Liza, the student we intro-
duced at the beginning of the chapter, for example, struggled 
with judgments in the context of her test anxiety. The following 
excerpt is from a group interaction between the facilitator and 
Liza:
Counselor:	
Liza, what’s it like to try and not judge yourself when your 
mind wanders or you get distracted when you meditate?

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
129
Liza:	
Well, I find that I am constantly judging myself. My mind 
is always saying things like “you should be better at 
this,”or “what’s wrong with you, your mind shouldn’t 
wander like this.” I feel like a failure when I meditate.
Counselor:	
I want you to know that these thoughts and feelings are 
very common when we first start to meditate, especially 
for people who are very hard on themselves. Many of us 
find that we have a “little voice in our head” that is very 
self-­critical. In mindfulness practice I want you to try to 
just notice this “voice” every time it comes up. Don’t try 
to change it. Just notice it (e.g., “Oh, there is that voice 
again”) and then return your attention to your breath. Try 
to not judge when this voice pops up. Just notice it 
without judgment and then come back to your breath.
Liza:	
But that’s so hard! The voice is constant.
Counselor:	
I know it’s hard. I really do. But what you will find is 
that with practice that voice will lose its power over you. 
You will begin to notice that it is “only a thought.” You 
will learn to not judge yourself so harshly. And this 
self-­judgment is at the root of most anxiety—­especially 
test anxiety.
4.	 Lead exercise in walking meditation (20-­30 minutes): Introduce 
walking meditation and then have group members go outside 
and practice. Discuss reactions to the exercise. In walking medi-
tation members are instructed to walk very slowly, in silence, 
and notice the movements of the body (e.g., the lifting and 
placing of the foot) in a very precise way. In walking meditation 
you are not “going” anywhere; you are simply noticing what it is 
like to move. This focus on body movement now becomes your 
“tether line to the present moment”—­instead of the breath or 
the body. And whenever your mind wanders off of the walking, 
you simply notice that it’s wandered and bring your attention 
back to your walking. Walking meditation is a very powerful 
technique and one that college students really enjoy. The pace of 
the walking should be very slow and deliberate so that each 
movement can be noticed and examined.

================================================================================

5.	 Lead exercise in sitting meditation (focus on breath or sounds or 
body)—­10 minutes.
6.	 Assign home practice for the week: (1) Do sitting or walking 
meditation (breath or body) for 10 minutes each day; (2) prac-
tice “non-­judgment” once each day when in public arena (e.g., 
on the bus, walking across campus); (3) do one act of “generos-
ity” this week.
Session 5
1.	 Lead sitting meditation exercise (10-­15 minutes).
2.	 Discuss home practice. In addition to doing sitting and/or 
walking meditation, the homework for the past week included 
doing “one act of generosity.” This exercise is usually very power-
ful for group members. The intention of the exercise is to “get 
outside of oneself—­one’s “little ego”—­and to practice “giving” 
rather than “taking.” Students report various interesting acts 
that they have done (e.g., taking a gift to a friend, helping 
someone who is struggling with groceries) and they often report 
that this act of generosity is very powerful for them—that 
“giving” instead of “taking” is more satisfying than they ever 
imagined. This act of “getting outside of oneself” is at the core 
of mindfulness meditation. Doing this allows us to develop a 
larger perspective—­a perspective that is beyond our focusing on 
what we want or think we deserve. It encourages people to see 
how focusing on something other than “what I want” makes 
them feel more content.
3.	 Introduce new mindfulness concepts during meditation exercise 
and home practice discussion: Emphasize that meditation is like 
“training a puppy”—­be gentle but firm, be consistent in bringing 
the mind back to the present moment, over and over and over 
again. Also we emphasize how mindfulness meditation develops 
the power of attention and a grateful heart.
4.	 Lead sitting meditation exercise (10-­15 minutes) with focus on 
body awareness or awareness of sounds.

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
131
5.	 Conduct exercise (20-30 minutes): Have students go outside, 
find a busy place on campus to sit, and just “observe without 
judgment.” This exercise emphasizes the use of mindfulness 
meditation in daily life—of being curious about what is happen-
ing in the world, and bringing your mind back to “just observ-
ing” anytime the mind wanders. This exercise is very powerful 
in demonstrating to students the practical application of mind-
fulness meditation to daily life.
6.	 Assign homework: (1) Do sitting meditation for 20 minutes each 
day; (2) do one small act of generosity each day; (3) have one 
period of “no judgment” this week; (4) do one meditation period 
outside this week.
Session 6
1.	 Lead exercise in sitting meditation (10-­15 minutes) with focus 
on breath, body, sounds.
2.	 Process home practice and introduce new mindfulness concept: 
the physical/medical and psychological benefits of mindfulness. 
In this session we present research evidence regarding the posi-
tive impact of meditation on various psychological (e.g., anxiety, 
panic, eating disorders, trauma, and so on) and medical condi-
tions (e.g., headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, high blood pres-
sure, and so on). This evidence always seems to impress the 
group members. At this point they often comment on how the 
mindfulness meditation has changed their lives either psycho-
logically or medically.
3.	 Lead exercise in walking meditation (20-­30 minutes).
4.	 Assign and discuss home practice: (1) Do sitting meditation 
each day (10-­15 minutes); (2) this week see if you can be aware 
of “your first thought upon waking up.”

================================================================================

Session 7
1.	 Lead exercise in sitting meditation (20 minutes).
2.	 Process home practice and introduce new concept: how mind-
fulness meditation naturally cultivates the “arising of wisdom 
and compassion.” This concept introduces another core concept 
of mindfulness meditation; that is, that when you do regular 
practice you naturally, without effort, develop compassion and 
wisdom. Members often report that they have indeed noticed 
this in their lives; for example, feeling less judgmental of their 
partner or their parents. They also report that they seem to have 
a larger perspective on life—­an example of a kind of wisdom. 
Liza, for example, reported more compassion for herself, which 
resulted in less perfectionism and self-­criticism—­and ultimately, 
less anxiety. She also reported that she can now see that her 
exams are not as important as she had always thought they 
were—­that there is more to life than getting As (an example of 
“wisdom”).
3.	 Exercise: Go outside and practice sitting meditation in a public 
place.
4.	 Assign home practice: (1) Do sitting meditation every day (15-­20 
minutes), (2) see if you can be aware of when something happens 
that you “don’t like” (e.g., a comment from a roommate or a poor 
grade), watch your attachment to “getting what you want,” and 
see if you can let go of that need.
Session 8
1.	 Lead exercise in sitting meditation (20 minutes).
2.	 Process home practice and introduce new concept: how to con-
tinue your mindfulness practice once group is over. Member 
feedback (and research) supports the notion that continuing the 
daily meditation practice is very difficult once the group is over. 
In this last session we discuss ways to increase the chances that 

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
133
members will continue to practice mindfulness meditation and 
mindful living. Some of the suggestions for continuing the prac-
tice are: finding a meditation group in the community and 
attending regularly, or finding a meditation “buddy”—­someone 
who will hold you accountable and encourage you to meditate, 
read books and articles on mindfulness meditation, and attend 
meditation retreats. Facilitators also offer to meet with group 
members individually if they need help continuing, or re-­starting, 
their practice.
3.	 Review what was covered in the group.
4.	 Ask students about changes they have experienced as a result of 
their practicing mindfulness and mindfulness meditation.
5.	 Conduct a closing meditation exercise emphasizing what they 
have learned in the group and the need to continue practicing 
mindfulness. Facilitators do a meditation/guided imagery exer-
cise where, once students have closed their eyes and gotten into 
a meditative state, facilitators review what they have learned in 
the group, affirm all the positive changes they have made, affirm 
their commitment to continuing to practice mindfulness medi-
tation and mindful living, and encourage them to continue their 
commitment to being more compassionate with themselves and 
with others.
6.	 Have members fill out a group feedback form asking about the 
strengths and weaknesses of the group.
Empirical Considerations
MBSR has been applied with a range of issues, including chronic physical 
pain, illnesses such as cancer, mental illnesses, including anxiety and 
depression, and non-­clinical issues, such as stress and burnout (cf. de 
Vibe, Bjørndal, Tipton, Hammerstrøm, & Kowalski, 2012). There have 
been a number of recent meta-­analyses of studies on MBSR and other 
mindfulness-­based interventions A recent meta-­analysis of 31 random-
ized controlled trials of MBSR (exclusively) showed medium effect sizes 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
134
for anxiety, depression, stress, mindfulness, quality of life, and personal 
development, and a small effect size for somatic health (de Vibe et al., 
2012). Other reviews showed that mindfulness-­based approaches such as 
MBSR and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) were effec-
tive in reducing anxiety and depression (Fjorback, Arendt, Ørnbøl, Fink, 
& Walach, 2011; Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010), that integrating 
MBSR in behavior therapy may enhance the efficacy of mindfulness-­
based interventions (Bohlmeijer, Prenger, Taal, & Cuijpers, 2010), and 
that MBSR is effective with non-­clinical populations as well, in terms of 
showing a non-­specific effect in reduction in stress, ruminative thinking, 
and trait anxiety, as well as an increase in empathy and self-­compassion 
(Chiesa & Serretti, 2009). Another meta-­analysis found that MBSR may 
indeed be helpful for the mental health of cancer patients; however, more 
research is needed to show convincing evidence for an effect on physical 
health per se (Ledesma & Kumano, 2009).
Although many MBSR trials have included college students as par-
ticipants, we are only aware of one study that tested the application of 
MBSR in a randomized control trial specifically with a college student 
sample. In that study (Oman, Shapiro, Thoresen, Plante, & Flinders, 
2008), college undergraduates were randomly assigned to an 8-­week, 90 
minute/week training in MBSR, to another type of meditation program, 
or to a no-­treatment waitlist. Data were collected at posttest and at 
8-­week follow-­up. Results showed that relative to those on the waitlist, 
students who received training in MBSR or the other meditation program 
experienced significant benefits for stress and forgiveness, with marginal 
benefits for rumination.
MBSR appears to be acceptable and effective with college students. 
The program described in this chapter resembles the one evaluated in 
the randomized controlled trial described above that showed positive 
findings (Oman et. al., 2008). Additionally, our experience conducting 
MBSR groups at a CCC for a number of years is that student members’ 
reactions to the group have been very positive. Members’ subjective 
reports suggest that the experiential exercises and home practice are 
helpful in getting the concepts of mindfulness meditation across. 
Anecdotal reports from members suggest changes in their lives, includ-
ing: (1) decreased levels of general anxiety, performance anxiety, test 
anxiety, social anxiety, (2) improvements in relationship, both romantic 
ones and friendships, (3) an increase in feelings of contentment and 

================================================================================
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with College Students
135
happiness with life, (4) decreased need for control in daily life (e.g., over 
a boyfriend’s behavior), (5) improved sleep, (6) decreases in headaches 
and/or muscle pain, (7) enhanced ability to study and do academic tasks 
(e.g., study, write papers).
In the future, it would be helpful to conduct research related to the 
success of MBSR groups with college students, particularly studying the 
impact of such a group on college student-­specific presentations, such as 
test anxiety. Likewise, research examining what mindfulness techniques 
are most effective with this population would provide valuable 
information.
Final Words
There are a few issues to consider before running an MBSR group with 
college students. Not all college students can successfully learn, let alone 
benefit from, mindfulness meditation. Two of the biggest obstacles to 
group members learning mindfulness are (1) members failing to do the 
home practice, and (2) members missing group sessions. We believe that 
the key to learning mindfulness is the consistent, daily practice, and the 
attending of every group session. Indeed, a recent study found that 
between-­session practice over the course of eight weeks of mindfulness-­
based relapse prevention was predictive of mindfulness at post-­treatment 
(although not at follow-­up) (Bowen & Kurtz, 2012). The need for stu-
dents to engage in group and regular mindfulness practice has led us to 
do a much more careful screening with students who want to be in the 
group. As noted above, we now meet with students interested in being in 
the group and screen for their level of motivation and commitment to 
attending all eight group sessions and to practicing daily. Any potential 
member who has any doubt about whether or not she can commit at this 
level is screened out of the group. This policy has led to a much lower 
dropout rate, thus increasing group cohesion and motivation. This 
screening approach has decreased the dropout rate from 30-­40% to less 
than 10%.
Group facilitators’ training and experience with mindfulness medi-
tation matter. It is essential that therapists running MBSR groups be 
well-­trained and have their own daily meditation practice. Our experi-
ence is that clinicians may become excited by the potential benefits of 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
136
MBSR and decide to offer this type of group without adequate training 
and/or without their own daily practice. With mindfulness meditation it 
is not just about the technique—­it is also about the lived experience of 
the leader. Recent findings lend preliminary support to this position that 
therapists’s training in mindfulness might enhance client outcomes (e.g., 
Grepmair et al., 2007).
Finally, although there is strong empirical support for MBSR in 
general (Kabat-­Zinn, 2003) and some support for using it with college 
students specifically (Oman et al., 2008), there is still a great deal we 
don’t know about the application of MBSR groups with college students. 
For example, we don’t know which college students are more likely to 
benefit from an MBSR group, or if there are ways to increase students’ 
motivation to engage in daily practice. We also don’t know what impact 
participation in an MBSR group might have on academic performance 
per se. Therefore, future studies could investigate potential moderators of 
treatment effects in this population, as well as the potential impact on 
academic performance.

J
ohn is in his junior year of an engineering program. He is in the top 
of his class with a high grade point average, but he repeatedly com-
plains of intense anxiety, stress, fatigue, and low self-­esteem. Sarah is 
in her sophomore year in a graphic design program. Sarah is intelligent 
and motivated, but she is on academic probation for low grades and has 
lost an academic scholarship. She reports difficulties with late assign-
ments, missed assignments, poor class attendance, and several failed 
classes. Surprisingly enough, both of these students are struggling with 
the same thing: perfectionism.
Perfectionism is a common problem among college student popula-
tions and is often part of treatment in college counseling centers (CCCs) 
as either a presenting problem or an underlying feature of a variety of 
other psychological problems. This chapter will review the nature of per-
fectionism with a focus on clinical presentations in college student popu-
lations, followed by a discussion of how to conceptualize perfectionism 
from an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) perspective and 
a “how to” section with a session by session outline of how ACT can be 
applied to perfectionism. Empirical considerations for the application of 
ACT for perfectionism will be reviewed, followed by a few concluding 
comments on potential issues in applying ACT with perfectionism with 
college students. The information in this chapter comes from a review of 
the current empirical literature on both perfectionism and ACT, but also 
relies heavily on our clinical experience working with perfectionism and 
related issues in college student populations.
Defining Perfectionism
Perfectionism is generally defined by two criteria: 1) unreasonably high 
standards or expectations, and 2) excessive self-­criticism when one fails 
to meet those standards (Burns, 1980). Perfectionistic thinking can be 
irrational and dysfunctional as evidenced by the perception of cata-
strophic outcomes when standards are not achieved. Performance is 
often evaluated by all-­or-­nothing criteria in which anything less than 
perfection is interpreted as failure, and there is persistent emotional and 
cognitive distress, best described as the “tyranny of the should” (Horney, 
1950, p. 197).

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
141
Current research suggests perfectionism can be multidimensional. 
This includes excessively high standards; heightened levels of concern 
over mistakes; a sense of doubt about the quality of one’s performance; 
concern over parents’ expectations and evaluations; and an overempha-
sis on precision, order, and organization (Frost, Marten, Lahart, & 
Rosenblate, 1990). Perfectionism can be experienced as self-­oriented 
(i.e., exacting standards and excessive critical evaluation of one’s perfor-
mance), other-­oriented (i.e., exacting standards and excessive critical 
evaluation of others), and socially prescribed (i.e., the perception or 
experience of exacting standards and excessive criticism from others; 
Hewitt & Flett, 1991b).
Adaptive and maladaptive dimensions of perfectionism have also 
been identified (Stoeber & Otto, 2006). Adaptive perfectionism has 
been characterized as a healthy pursuit of excellence, quality work, 
accomplishment, and high standards that can be adjusted according to 
the circumstances; whereas maladaptive perfectionism has been defined 
as inflexible high standards, impossible expectations, persistent dissatis-
faction with performance, and performance motivated by a fear of failure. 
This chapter will focus on the maladaptive presentation of perfection-
ism, although the adaptive dimension highlights the insidious nature of 
perfectionism where good intentions (e.g., a desire to achieve high aca-
demic standards) can take a pathological turn.
Perfectionism has been linked to a host of negative outcomes, includ-
ing depression (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a), anxiety (Alden, Ryder, & 
Mellings, 2002), eating disorders (Goldner, Cockell, & Srikameswaran, 
2002), obsessive-­compulsive disorder (Frost & Steketee, 1997), and sui-
cidal ideation (Hewitt, Flett, & Weber, 1994). In student populations, 
perfectionism has been linked to poor overall adjustment to college life 
(Rice & Dellwo, 2002), procrastination (Flett, Blankstein, Hewitt, & 
Koledin, 1992), low self-­esteem and interpersonal difficulties among 
gifted students (Parker, 2002), greater psychological distress in medical, 
dental, pharmacy, and nursing students (Henning, Ey, & Shaw, 1998), 
depression and hopelessness in medical students (Enns, Cox, Sareen, & 
Freeman, 2001), and even suicide, particularly among minority students 
(Chang, 1998). In a diathesis stress model, socially prescribed perfection-
ism has been shown to interact with stress to influence overall psycho-
logical adjustment in college students (Chang & Rand, 2000).

Clinical Presentations of 
Perfectionism in College Students
Typical clinical presentations of perfectionism occur either as a primary 
presenting problem or as an underlying issue of another psychopathology. 
As a primary issue, individuals may present with perfectionistic cogni-
tive/emotional distress, and/or perfectionistic problematic behaviors that 
may lead to poor performance. The distress may include feelings of 
anxiety, anger, or sadness associated with the irrational all-­or-­nothing 
cognitions. It is common to see symptoms of both anxiety and depression 
as a manifestation of the fear of failure coupled with the sense of hope-
lessness and low self-­worth from the perception of poor performance. It 
is also common to see a presentation of the cognitive/emotional distress 
without any problematic behaviors. For example, as in the case of John 
from the introduction, a student may seek help because he feels “over-
whelmed” or “stressed,” stating that he feels that he is not doing well in 
school. Further assessment reveals that his grades are near perfect and he 
is managing his current course load, but he has been “pushing through” 
in an attempt to satisfy the high standards. The distress is typically a 
result of the immense amount of effort required to consistently meet 
these standards and/or the intense self-­criticism because the perfor-
mance is never “good enough.”
When perfectionistic behaviors are present, it is also common to see 
a student who is performing well below her academic potential, as exem-
plified in the case of Sarah discussed at the beginning of the chapter. 
The poor performance may manifest in three different ways. First, a 
student may avoid class or assignments because of the pressure to be 
perfect or because she would rather receive no credit for an assignment 
than achieve something less than perfection. Second, a student may 
perform poorly because of procrastination. Because of the desire to 
perform perfectly (create the perfect set of flash cards, have perfect focus 
on reading a chapter), she may put the task off until she has time to really 
do it well only to end up cramming for an exam or rushing to complete 
an assignment, turning it in late, or not finishing it at all. Third, a student 
may “push through” trying to meet the high standards and tolerating the 
self-­criticism, but eventually burn out because of intense cognitive, emo-
tional, and physical distress. She may stop attending classes altogether or 

================================================================================

fall far behind on coursework resulting in low grades for the semester. In 
these cases, the student typically will regroup for the next semester and 
begin again with the perfect performance, only to burn out again as the 
semester progresses, and may present for services in a CCC after the first 
semester of burnout or after several semesters when her academic stand-
ing is in jeopardy. The great irony is that all of the attempts to achieve 
perfection typically result in performance that falls much further below 
the standards of perfection.
When perfectionism is an underlying issue of other psychopathology, 
it may be a central problem behind the symptoms, or it may be an auxil-
iary feature that makes addressing the primary symptoms difficult. In the 
case of the former, a student may present with clear symptoms of depres-
sion, but one of the central underlying issues is perfectionism. As an 
auxiliary feature, it may impede efforts to deal with adjustment issues 
from the transition to college life, or it may be a component of an eating 
disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder.
In all of these cases, whether as a presenting problem or an underly-
ing issue, perfectionism may also be present in the treatment process. 
The unrealistic expectations and self-­criticism may be manifest in how 
the student interacts with treatment goals, homework assignments, 
expectations of the therapist, and overall expectations for the therapy 
process. These problems can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of moti-
vation or interest, or taking comments too literally, so it is important to 
watch for the presence of perfectionism and make it a target of treatment 
when merited.
Conceptualizing Perfectionism from 
an ACT Perspective
To understand perfectionism from an ACT perspective, it is important to 
first clarify the difference between internal experiences and behaviors. 
Internal experiences include thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations, 
all of which are manifest in the experience of perfectionism (e.g., all-­or-­
nothing thinking accompanied by a fear of failure and the physical symp-
toms of anxiety such as muscle tension and a nervous stomach). These 
internal experiences are only experienced by the individual and are 

================================================================================

144
difficult, if not impossible, to control, and stand in contrast to overt 
behaviors that are generally observable and possible to control. Typical 
perfectionistic behaviors include excessive effort or time spent on a task, 
or the behavioral avoidance of working on tasks.
Psychological Inflexibility
The ACT construct of psychological inflexibility provides a clear 
conceptualization of perfectionism that addresses both internal experi-
ences and behaviors. Psychological inflexibility refers to a rigid, literal, 
and inflexible style of responding to internal experiences (thoughts, feel-
ings, and physical sensations) resulting in psychological distress and is 
often accompanied by problematic or avoidant behaviors (Hayes, Luoma, 
Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006). The characteristics of inflexibility and 
rigidity are common in perfectionism. Perfectionistic standards are inflex-
ible by definition, and perfectionists rigidly hold to those standards.
The idea of psychological inflexibility is central to a relatively new 
conceptual model of perfectionism that differentiates positive (adaptive) 
and negative (maladaptive) perfectionism based on how an individual 
interacts with high standards (Stoeber & Otto, 2006). Perfectionism is 
characterized by the presence of perfectionistic strivings (high standards) 
and positive and negative perfectionists are distinguished by their type 
and level of perfectionistic actions. Perfectionistic concerns are charac-
terized by rigid and inflexible concern over mistakes, doubts about 
actions, evaluation of the discrepancy between achievement and stan-
dards, self-­criticism, and a fear of failure. In this functional model, the 
flexible relationship between perfectionistic concerns and action exem-
plifies the idea of psychological inflexibility—­that literal and rigid inter-
action with internal experience can, but does not have to, occur.
A functional approach to perfectionism differentiates adaptive and 
maladaptive perfectionism, suggesting that high standards are not inher-
ently problematic (to be clear, there are some times when standards are 
clearly unreasonable); instead, it is the inflexible interaction with the high 
standards that is the problem. This is an important consideration for work 
with college students because of the nature of the academic environment 
in which the standards are high and competition can be fierce. Sometimes, 
the standards may be high but appropriate for the situation and the nature

of the intervention is developing a flexible set of responses to the high 
standards and internal experiences that arise from falling short. In con-
trast to basic cognitive interventions in which the rationality of the stan-
dards is challenged, an ACT intervention would target the rigid response 
to the standards and the way the individual interacts with internal experi-
ences. The student does not have to be asked to lower or change his 
standards, but instead, to evaluate his response to the standards.
The basic science behind ACT provides an explanation for how and 
why individuals can develop these patterns of inflexible interaction with 
internal experiences. Relational Frame Theory (RFT) forms the under-
lying basic science that leads to ACT as a therapeutic intervention 
(Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011). RFT is a broad research program on 
human language and cognition, and the research suggests that because 
of the relational way in which learning language occurs, internal experi-
ences, along with their verbal labels, can form complex relational net-
works that can assume meaning beyond the actual literal content of the 
thought or experience. To clarify this in the context of perfectionism, 
consider how irrational it is for a perfectionistic individual to take zero 
credit for an assignment as an alternative to a less than perfect perfor-
mance. In this case, the thought, “anything less than perfect is a failure,” 
is taken literally and thus makes no credit (failure) effectively equivalent 
to “anything less than perfect.” If the thought, “anything less than perfect 
is a failure,” is taken literally, then it makes sense that he would engage 
in such apparently irrational behavior, because in the literal world of 
internal experience, he is acting rationally. RFT explains how a thought 
can assume so much literal influence over behavior. Imagine the per-
sonal history of experiences, particularly emotional experiences, con-
nected or related to this thought, “anything less than perfect is a failure.” 
This thought, which may seem ridiculous to the clinician, may carry 
years of relational meaning that makes the content of the thought some-
thing that has to be addressed, so that in responding to this thought the 
student may be figuratively cowering in fear before a demanding parent. 
This literal interaction with internal experiences is referred to as cogni-
tive fusion, in which an individual treats a stimulus (e.g., a thought) as 
though it is literal and true and must be followed, rather than treating 
the thought as just a thought (an example of defusion). Thus, certain 
private experiences have significantly more influence over behavior. The 
nature of this relational learning can then lead to rigid patterns of 

================================================================================

146
interaction with internal experiences that may result in psychopathology 
and maladaptive behaviors (Hayes et al., 2006).
Experiential Avoidance
The construct of psychological inflexibility provides a theoretical 
explanation for the role of internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, physi-
cal sensations) in perfectionism. To understand perfectionistic behaviors, 
another central idea from ACT, experiential avoidance provides impor-
tant insight. In an ACT conceptualization, maladaptive perfectionistic 
behaviors function to control or avoid perfectionistic thoughts, feelings, 
and/or physical sensations. Experiential avoidance is apparent in the 
three types of perfectionistic behaviors discussed in the clinical presenta-
tions. In the case of avoiding academic tasks, the student may skip an 
assignment to avoid experiencing the thoughts, “I’m a failure,” feelings of 
fear and sadness, and the physical manifestations of anxiety. When pro-
crastination occurs, the student may put off an assignment to avoid the 
thought, “it isn’t good enough,” along with the accompanying anxiety 
and frustration. When a student “pushes through” and burns out trying 
to produce perfect work, he may be avoiding the fear of failure. In all of 
these situations, unwanted immediate internal experiences are exchanged 
for long-­term consequences.
Experiential avoidance has an insidious nature, as it works well in 
the short term, but can ultimately make the struggle with these internal 
experiences worse. According to RFT, attempts to control internal expe-
rience will only create additional complex relationships, and the indi-
vidual will become increasingly entangled in the content. For example, if 
an individual tries not to think about something, he will likely think of 
it more often as proposed in RFT and supported in the thought-­control 
literature (Wenzlaff & Wegner, 2000). RFT also suggests that whatever 
the individual does to avoid or change the distressing thoughts will now 
be associated with the distressing thoughts (Hayes et al., 2011). Thus, in 
an attempt to control internal experiences, he may become more entan-
gled with the content of his thoughts, resulting in maladaptive behaviors 
and neglecting important activities in his life.
The target of ACT for perfectionism is increasing psychological flex-
ibility (Hayes et al., 2006). The intended outcome is to decrease 

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
147
problematic behaviors (maladaptive experiential avoidance) and increase 
adaptive behaviors more consistent with the values of the student such as 
engaging and successfully completing academic tasks. The focus of the 
intervention is on the willingness to experience whatever internal expe-
riences may occur and shift the focus to behavior guided by values. As 
discussed in chapter 3, this is achieved by fostering six core processes: 1) 
acceptance, the active and willing experience of the problematic internal 
experiences that have been previously avoided, 2) defusion, the process of 
recognizing the literal function of cognitions instead of their derived 
cognitive relational functions, 3) contact with the present moment, the 
awareness of all of the internal experiences that are occurring without 
judgment, 4) viewing the self as context, the process of seeing the self as 
the arena in which internal experiences occur and not as defining quali-
ties, 5) values, the direction in life that an individual chooses to follow 
that motivates and guides the choices he makes, and 6) committed action, 
an increase in patterns of behavior that are consistent with what the 
individual values in life.
ACT Treatment for Perfectionism
Using the conceptual foundation from this chapter, any ACT exercise, 
metaphor, or technique (see Hayes et al., 2011) can be adapted to treat 
perfectionism in a college student population. This section will provide 
an outline of ACT for perfectionism. Where standard ACT material is 
appropriate, only general references will be made, whereas material that 
has been specifically adapted or created for work with perfectionism will 
be presented in more detail. The order of presentation is generally appro-
priate and a 12-­session outline is provided, but because ACT is a 
principle-­based intervention, the order or number of sessions can easily 
be adjusted as needed.
Session 1: Establish Treatment Goals
Discussion about the pros and cons of perfectionism can introduce 
the need for treatment goals. As perfectionistic behaviors can be adap-
tive, the targets for treatment are not always immediately clear to the 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
148
therapist or the client. This is a collaborative process and the therapist 
assumes a supportive posture to help the client identify personal treat-
ment goals. Expect the goals to change as treatment progresses, but try 
to identify some concrete behavioral goals from the outset of treatment 
so that there is a clear goal, such as increasing the percentage of assign-
ment completion or class attendance for someone struggling academi-
cally, or increasing the number of outside pleasurable activities for 
someone who is headed toward burnout. Additional treatment goals can 
be added as treatment progresses.
As discussed in the conceptual section in this chapter, make a clear 
distinction between internal experiences (i.e., thoughts, feelings, physical 
sensations) and overt behaviors. This can be done experientially by 
having the client describe an experience with perfectionism that was 
particularly difficult. Guide the discussion and point out the internal 
experiences. It can be helpful to choose a label that will generically refer 
to the variety of perfectionistic internal experiences that the client expe-
riences (e.g., “shoulds”). The question of control can also be introduced 
here using the following exercise:
Therapist (T):	 Let’s say that I will give you $100,000 if you are able to 
complete all of your assignments in the next week. 
Could you do it?
Client (C):	
I think so. I would definitely try.
T:	
Sounds good. Now, what if I told you that I would double your 
money if you could also make it through that week without 
experiencing any of the “shoulds” we talked about?
C:	 I think that’s impossible.
This exercise reinforces the difference between internal experiences 
and overt behaviors, and also introduces the idea that one key distinction 
is control. Sometimes, instead of immediately recognizing that control of 
internal experience is impossible, a perfectionistic student may respond, 
“I know that other people can do that, and I should be able to, but I 
haven’t figured it out yet.” The counselor can respond to this by pointing 
out that he responded to a question about controlling the “shoulds” with 
one more “should,” and point out how perfectionism can be part of the 
treatment process. Encourage the student to trust his experience (i.e., 

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
149
“Have you ever been able to totally control the ‘shoulds?’”), and be skepti-
cal of the “shoulds.” For homework, ask the client to pay close attention to 
this process in his experiences between sessions.
Session 2: Creative Hopelessness
Ask the client to identify all of the strategies he has used to control or 
avoid the “shoulds.” Write them down and once a good list has been 
created, ask the client to rate the short-­term effectiveness of each strategy. 
Then, ask for a rating of the long-­term effectiveness of each strategy. Ask 
if he would even be in therapy if the long-­term strategies had been effec-
tive. Suggest that the perfectionistic behaviors should be on the list as 
well, as they are probably one of the primary strategies to control or avoid. 
Ask the client to identify the negative outcomes associated with perfec-
tionistic actions, and then ask him to identify the negative outcomes asso-
ciated with the “battle” with the “shoulds.” Help the client see that this 
has been an ineffective battle, and that it may have resulted in negative 
outcomes in quality of life. Compare this struggle to trying to use a shovel 
to dig his way out of a hole (“Man in the Hole” metaphor, Hayes et al., 
2011). It is helpful here to point out the persistent effort: that the client has 
continued to try despite repeated struggles, and the failures may not be 
because of a lack of effort or intellect, but simply due to using the wrong 
tool for the job. Ask the client if he is willing to “put down the shovel.” 
Ask the client to think about and practice this idea between sessions.
Session 3: Control Is the Problem
The goal of this session is to help the client understand and experi-
ence the paradox of control over internal experiences, that the effort to 
control or avoid internal content is not only ineffective but typically 
results in an increase in the frequency and intensity of the internal expe-
riences and greater difficulty in life in general. This can be accomplished 
using standard ACT interventions such as the “Chocolate Cake” exer-
cise or “Polygraph” metaphor (see Hayes et al., 2011), while also remind-
ing the student of his inability to stop “shoulds” from occurring in his 
head even if guaranteed $100,000. Encourage the client to identify and 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
150
describe personal experiences in which this paradox occurred. This can 
all be tied together using the following discussion, which often resonates 
with perfectionistic thinking:
T:	
Do you participate in sports, art, music, or anything like that?
C:	 I play the piano.
T:	
How do you become a good piano player?
C:	 Practice. A lot of practice.
T:	
Right, the more effort you put into it, the better you become. You 
would expect then, that all your effort, or practice, to control the 
“shoulds” would get you somewhere. Are things getting easier?
C:	 No, much harder.
T:	
And it seems you try harder each year. It seems to be working the 
other way—the more you fight, the worse your problem becomes.
After the client feels the nature of the paradox of attempted internal 
control, introduce the idea of acceptance as an alternative: that it may 
work better to acknowledge the internal experiences and focus on behav-
iors that can occur independently of internal experience (e.g., turn in an 
assignment while experiencing the feeling of dread and the thought, “it 
isn’t good enough”). This can be illustrated using the “Two Scales” meta-
phor (Hayes et al., 2011). Ask the client to practice this by identifying 
two or three concrete behavioral goals where he can practice accepting 
the inner experiences that show up (e.g., read a chapter in a limited 
amount of time, turn in an assignment, or prepare flash cards for a test). 
One can expect mixed success with this homework, as it can be difficult 
to behave independently of internal experiences. Difficulties with the 
idea of acceptance can be used to create a need for further material and 
introduce the importance of cognitive defusion.
Sessions 4-­6: Cognitive Defusion
The “Tug-­of-­War with a Monster” metaphor (Hayes et al., 2011) pro-
vides a nice review of acceptance and introduces the idea of defusion. In 

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
151
the metaphor, letting go of the rope is compared to letting go of ineffec-
tive strategies to control one’s inner experiences. This metaphor can 
resonate with clients with perfectionism because they often hold fast to 
the idea that if they just keep trying, they will eventually succeed and 
there is evidence for this because they have done it in other areas of life. 
This can be compared to the metaphor, where they do gain ground in 
the tug-­of-­war and there is hope that they may eventually win if they can 
just put together a consistent pattern of perfect “tugging.” A client may 
say, “I struggle, but I just need to be more disciplined and then things will 
be okay,” or, “I really want to live my life like this, I just need to be more 
consistent.” A student may be reluctant to let go of the attempted inter-
nal control strategy for several reasons: 1) it may help him be productive, 
2) his efforts are often reinforced by teachers, peers, and parents, and 3) 
it can be frightening to let go of something that provides a sense of struc-
ture (e.g., the metaphorical rope) because at least he has something to 
hold on to. Be sensitive to these fears, but point out the cost of the per-
fectionism and encourage him to take the risk of trying something new. 
As the client metaphorically tries to “let go of the rope,” the idea of defu-
sion can be introduced by asking him:
T:	
What have you been battling against in this tug-­of-­war anyway?
C:	 A monster. The “shoulds.”
T:	
I wonder if you have been so busy fighting to hold your ground 
that you don’t know much about what you are fighting against. 
I mean, what are the “shoulds,” anyway? Maybe we can take a 
look at what they are.
Here, traditional defusion exercises (Hayes et al., 2011; see chapters 
3 and 4 in this book for additional ideas) can be used to target cognitive 
fusion, including the limits of language, undermining verbal rules, and 
teaching nonjudgmental awareness. Verbal rules can be particularly 
strong with perfectionism and can provide good material for defusion 
work. Several verbal rules may be observed as concepts are introduced 
(e.g., “Oh, so if I do this acceptance thing, then I will finally be okay”). 
This can be undermined by being intentionally vague, ambiguous, or 
funny when the client is forming a rule, such as “Yes, I can 100% guar-
antee that anxiety may go down… (pause), or it may go up, or stay the 
same.”

================================================================================

Sessions 7-­8: Self as Context and Contact 
with the Present Moment
The “Passengers on the Bus” metaphor (Hayes et al., 2011), where 
internal experiences are related to passengers on a bus that influence the 
behavior of the driver (i.e., the student), can be both a defusion and a 
self-as-context intervention and provides a nice transition between the 
two processes. The idea that the student can define who he is by where 
he decides to drive the bus (i.e., what he does), independent of the pas-
sengers, is poignant for a perfectionistic student. Being in control is the 
primary objective of perfectionism. Many of the passengers on the stu-
dent’s bus have to do with the need to be perfect: “This is not A work;” 
“You need to work harder;” “It’s better to not do the assignment than to 
turn in something mediocre;” anxiety when doing something fun or 
facing an assignment, and so on. To quiet these passengers down, the 
student may simply “comply” with the passengers and do as they say (i.e., 
work harder or stop working, going out or not going out with a friend, 
depending on the student). At other times, he may argue back with the 
passengers or try to get rid of them. The irony is that in his efforts to 
argue back (“But I always get As”) or try to get the passengers (e.g., 
anxiety) off the bus, he has often stopped driving altogether and totally 
lost sight of who he wants to be. This can be an important moment in 
treatment as he can decide who he is, independent of the internal 
content, and he can define who he is by what he does instead. Standard 
self-as-context exercises (Hayes et al., 2011; see chapters 3 and 4 in this 
book) can be used to reinforce the process as needed.
Contact with the present moment work can occur in two ways. First, 
because the perfectionistic “shoulds” can become direct stumbling blocks 
in the treatment process, there are many opportunities to identify strug-
gles with perfectionism in session, in the present moment. The therapist 
can point out experiential avoidance or cognitive defusion as they 
happen in the moment and guide the client through application of the 
acceptance and defusion interventions. This helps undermine a common 
occurrence with perfectionism, wherein a client will intellectually under-
stand an idea and then think that he will have to practice it “when I get 

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
153
a chance” outside of the session, or “when I have time to really focus on 
it and maybe do some extra reading to make sure I really understand 
this.” The “shoulds” are influencing the student in this scenario and the 
therapist can help him engage the present moment, just as it is, with 
what skills he has, as understood at that moment. Second, a perfection-
istic client will often be preoccupied by thoughts about the future. Every 
experience is evaluated against a future-oriented perfectionistic ideal, 
not for what it is in the present moment. There is a sense of “waiting.” 
You may notice language such as, “As soon as,” or “If only I had.” The 
client is so focused on what he wants to become that he loses sight of the 
only thing that can help achieve those goals—­what he chooses to do in 
the present moment. Present-moment interventions will call attention to 
what the student’s mind is doing at that very moment, such as “What is 
your mind saying or trying to do right now?” “Which passengers are 
showing up now as I say this?” “Where can you feel it in your body?” The 
purpose of these interventions is to help the student catch these unhelp-
ful processes as they occur in the moment.
Sessions 9-­10: Focus on Client Values
Values work with a perfectionistic client can proceed as in standard 
ACT interventions (Hayes et al., 2011). Values are defined as the overall 
direction(s) an individual would like to take in life. Reinforce the idea 
with the student that values are a choice, independent of internal experi-
ences, and can serve to guide life goals as well as everyday decisions. A 
values clarification exercise can be used to identify personal values to 
provide direction now that the student is more in control of her life. This 
is a place for caution, as it is rare to find a perfectionistic student who has 
not spent time developing goals, personal mission statements, or any 
other similar personal organization tasks. Thus, the values work is fertile 
ground for application of all of the ACT skills as he has to practice 
acceptance of, and defusion from, the “shoulds” as he considers what he 
wants his life to be all about. With some clients, less structure is better 
when it comes to values work.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
154
Sessions 11-­12: Committed Action and 
Ending Treatment
Committed action can be addressed throughout treatment as you 
encourage the client to engage academic or personal tasks as part of 
homework to practice the other ACT skills. Try to develop a theme of 
“doing,” “engaging,” or “completing” throughout treatment, in contrast 
to the trap of experiential avoidance or excessive perfectionistic behav-
iors. A good metaphor to illustrate this theme is a comparison of engag-
ing in perfectionist behaviors with a sports team that focuses all its efforts 
on playing defense and never takes the risks necessary to score points. 
Encourage the client to focus more on offense and taking risks in order 
to be more engaged in life.
At this point in treatment, the idea of acceptance can bring together 
all the ACT processes. The goal is for the client to recognize that if he 
can be accepting about who he is, what he experiences (internal experi-
ences, in particular), and what he is capable of, then he can be free to 
become who he wants to be. He can live a life independent of internal 
experience. This can be presented using a metaphor that arose from our 
work with perfectionism.
T:	
Can you describe one of your favorite places in nature?
C:	 I like to hike in the mountains near where I grew up. When I 
am there, I feel a sense of peace and I am in awe of the beauty 
of nature.
T:	
How much order, straight lines, or symmetry is there in nature?
C:	 Not much, there seems to be a randomness to it all, but it is 
beautiful.
T:	
So it may not meet traditional standards of perfection, at least as 
you’ve been describing, but it is still beautiful. I would even go so 
far as to say that the “random” beauty of nature is more beautiful 
than the meticulously manicured, symmetrical gardens of any 
country estate.

================================================================================
Using ACT to Treat Perfectionism
155
C:	 Yeah, I would choose the mountains anytime.
T:	
When you are being perfectionistic in school, in your life, I have 
this image in my mind of you in the mountains trying to rearrange 
the rocks and replant the flowers to bring more organization and 
more symmetry to the landscape. I wonder if that is what you have 
been doing with school, with your family, with your life.
C:	 (Laughs.) Yeah.
T:	
Can you see how this is a choice? What if you chose to appreciate 
the world around you, and the world inside you, for what it is, and 
focus on living the best you can?
This metaphor can be used as a reminder when the client is getting 
stuck. For example, if he is focusing on the need to be perfect, you can 
ask, “What are you doing now…replanting the wildflowers?”
Empirical Considerations
Because perfectionism is often an underlying feature of a specific disor-
der or an overt behavioral problem (e.g., poor academic performance), it 
has received relatively little attention in the treatment literature com-
pared to common Axis I disorders like major depressive disorder or gen-
eralized anxiety. However, the widespread impact of the problem (i.e., 
the association with negative outcomes and severe psychopathology) 
would suggest the need for a treatment that directly targets perfection-
ism. There are a handful of treatment studies looking at cognitive behav-
ioral therapy for perfectionism (Kearns, Forbes, & Gardiner, 2007; Riley, 
Lee, & Cooper, 2007), but there is a clear need for treatment research 
that directly addresses perfectionism. It is hoped this chapter will con-
tribute by providing a theoretical framework based on the current litera-
ture to initiate outcome work with ACT for perfectionism.
ACT has been shown to be an effective treatment for numerous 
functionally similar psychological problems in which experiential avoid-
ance is an issue, including depression, substance abuse, and chronic pain 
(Hayes et al., 2006). Cognitive theory suggests that experiential 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
156
avoidance is a common causal factor across the anxiety disorders 
(Olatunji, Forsyth, & Feldner, 2007), and this would support the use of a 
treatment that targets experiential avoidance. There is also an evidence 
base that ACT is effective with disorders often associated with perfec-
tionism, such as depression (Zettle & Rains, 1989), generalized anxiety 
(Roemer, Orsillo, & Salters-­Pedneault, 2008), and obsessive compulsive 
disorder (Twohig et al., 2010). There is evidence that the individual ACT 
processes are effective individually in producing the intended change, 
including acceptance (Eifert & Forsyth, 2003), defusion (Masuda, Hayes, 
Sackett, & Twohig, 2004), and values work (Dahl, Wilson, & Nilsson, 
2004). Preliminary research has been conducted in a case study using the 
ACT approach described in this chapter and the initial findings show an 
increase in productivity, assignment completion, and class attendance, as 
well as decreased distress and improved overall quality of life (Crosby & 
Twohig, 2009).
Final Words
The intervention, as presented here, is adapted to traditional individual 
therapy, but the approach is also appropriate for other venues. For official 
clients of a CCC, the material can be presented in a traditional therapy 
group or even in a group that has a psychoeducational focus. Because 
many individuals struggling with this problem fall in the nonclinical 
range and may not see themselves as candidates for formal psychother-
apy, we have had a lot of success (i.e., high attendance) presenting the 
material in an educational workshop format. We have found advertising 
for a “Perfectionism Workshop” generates a lot of interest, and many 
individuals have expressed appreciation for the resource. We believe pre-
senting it as an educational workshop eliminated some of the barriers of 
seeking help, especially the stigma of being in therapy. We also cooper-
ated with the university academic resource center, and this relationship 
was a helpful source of referrals and workshop coordination. We have 
experimented with presenting the material in a single session as part of a 
series of workshops and as a four-­part workshop spread over four weeks.

G
iulia is a 20-­year-­old student in her second year of a three-­year 
undergraduate course in Interpreting, Translation, Linguistic 
and Cultural Studies at IULM University in Milan. She recently 
lost several university credits during her first year due to a misunder-
standing. She believes that she had talked to the professor’s assistant and 
received permission to skip a seminar included as part of the class. The 
assistant reportedly gave her the permission, but at the end of the year 
Giulia learned that she had not received credits for the class. She talked 
about the problem with the professor and his assistant but they attributed 
it to a misunderstanding and noted that the situation could not be

remedied. They found a compromise, where Giulia was allowed to attend 
the seminar and take the final exam during her second year. This meant 
that Giulia had to take extra hours of classes during the second year and 
that she would not receive the credits for a long period of time.
This event resulted in Giulia feeling very upset, desperate, and vic-
timized. Giulia is a very enthusiastic and effective student when she feels 
comfortable with the subject matter and the professor. However, when 
she doesn’t, she tends to withdraw from the situation and lose interest. 
Her grades were quite good during the first year, despite her varying 
motivation. After losing those credits, she felt so overwhelmed by the 
idea of retaking part of the course and the exam that she started losing 
interest in both classes and studying. She started missing some of the 
exams and thought about giving up studying. She reported feeling help-
less and resentful that this had happened to her due to someone else’s 
fault, and seemed to be losing confidence in both herself and the univer-
sity’s professionals.
This case illustrates a frequent problem on campuses: When stu-
dents become distraught, they are more likely to stop their studies. One 
of the main objectives of college counseling centers (CCCs) is to help 
students cope with their difficulties during the process of adaptation to 
the university life and context. University administrators generally share 
this goal, particularly given that emotional difficulties encountered by 
students in the first year of college are frequently associated with dropout 
(Rickinson & Rutherford, 1995).
Persistence and Retention Problems 
in Higher Education Are Pervasive 
and Costly across the World
High dropout rates among college students are not a situation unique to 
the U.S.A. Other countries, such as Australia and Italy, suffer from 
similar issues regarding the need to improve retention on college cam-
puses (Maslen, 2004; ISTAT, 2009). In 2004, the Australian federal edu-
cation minister, Dr. Brendan Nelson, expressed concern that 40,000 
Australian students would drop out of degree courses that year (Maslen, 

================================================================================
Podcasts to Help Students in Australia and Italy

2004). The Australian Commonwealth government’s “Review of 
Australian Higher Education” determined that Australian universities 
had an average dropout rate of 28% (Bradley, Noonan, Nugent, & Scales, 
2008). Similarly, as outlined in the latest data made available by the 
Organization for Economic Co-­operation and Development (OECD) 
and the Italian National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT), high dropout 
rates from college plague the Italian university system as well (ISTAT, 
2009; OECD, 2010). The OECD data on the number of students enrolled 
in a tertiary education program who graduate (“completion rate”) in 
Italy, as well as Germany, Greece, and Switzerland, are missing. Among 
the 18 OECD countries for which this data is available, the percentage 
of students who begin higher education but are unable to obtain a degree 
(e.g. Bachelor’s or Master’s degree) is 31% (OECD, 2010). This percent-
age rises to 54% in the U.S., while it is lower for several other European 
countries: 35% in the United Kingdom, 21% in France, 24% in Spain, 
28% in Portugal, 24% in Belgium, 16% in Denmark, and 28% in Finland.
In Italy, the latest available data (ISTAT, 2009) reveals that within 
the cohort of university students who enrolled in 2001-­2002, 62% had 
not obtained a terminal university degree by 2007. These data, although 
not directly comparable with those collected by the OECD, seem to indi-
cate a higher dropout rate, or at least a slower completion rate, in Italy 
than in other OECD countries.
In addition to dropping out of college, Italian students are taking 
longer to graduate: In 2007, according to ISTAT data (2009), almost 63% 
of the 249,593 graduates took longer to graduate than expected. As many 
as 76.5% of students who obtain a Master’s degree take longer than 
expected (ISTAT, 2009)—­a fact that has led to a saying in Italian 
Universities that “3+2 (years of education) usually is equal to 7 or more.”2
2	 Since 1999 the Italian system for degree fits the framework of the so-­called 3+2 
system, developed in the contest of the Bologna Process (see http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Bologna_Process for more details). Degree studies start immediately after high 
school and involve the students full-time. The first degree is the Laurea triennale that 
can be achieved after three years of studies and corresponds to a Bachelor’s Degree. Two 
additional years of specialization lead to the Laurea Magistrale, which corresponds to a 
Master’s Degree. Only the Laurea Magistrale grants access to third cycle programs 
(Post-MA degrees, Doctorates, or Specializing schools). There is also a five-year degree, 
“Laurea Magistrale Quinquennale” (Five Years Master of Arts), for programs such as 
Law and Medicine.

Although one may argue that delayed graduation can also be attrib-
uted to an ineffective curriculum that needs reprogramming, from the 
point of view of CCCs, this is recognized as a potential indicator of 
student distress. Delayed graduation and dropout from universities may 
impact students in terms of less motivation to study, a reduction in self-­
efficacy, guilt over the protracted cost of studies to the family, and, 
finally, a delay in gaining economic autonomy.
Giulia, the student described at the beginning of the chapter, never 
thought to seek help at the CCC, because she felt very deeply that she 
was a victim of unfair circumstances and had become increasingly dis-
trustful of university faculty and staff. Throughout the chapter we will 
use Giulia’s story to illustrate the potential utility of the mindfulness-­
based podcasts to be described later in the chapter. Giulia’s story conveys 
the difficulty in reaching students who may not be willing to come into 
treatment.
We Need More Accessible 
Ways to Reach Psychologically 
Distressed College Students
Although CCCs, across the world, are the first resource available to stu-
dents, these services are almost always available through face-­to-­face 
contact. However, the counselor-­student ratio may sometimes be as high 
as 1:5,500 (Gallagher, 2011). Thus, if the prevalence of mental health 
problems in the student population reflects that of the population at 
large, it would be impossible for CCCs to address these problems through 
in-­person counseling. Additionally, students who work may not be able 
to access counseling services, which typically operate during business 
hours. There is also a large proportion of college students who might 
never consult with counseling services because of the stigma associated 
with “seeing a shrink” (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009).
In addition to diagnosable mental health problems that can impact 
students’ achievement (Andrews & Wilding, 2004), incoming college 
students face a number of developmental challenges: moving to a differ-
ent context both in terms of social and family relationships, facing higher 

================================================================================
Podcasts to Help Students in Australia and Italy
163
study demands, and experiencing increased personal and social expecta-
tions about grades and performances, to name just a few. Thus, the 
average student, who may not be suffering from a clinically diagnosable 
problem or feel stressed enough to seek services at a CCC, might none-
theless benefit in some way by learning coping skills. Two factors could 
guide the selection of a medium for delivery of psychological interven-
tions to college students: a) finding a training format fitting to young 
adults’ habits and language and b) being able to reach the largest number 
of students in order to contain costs. Both of these factors point to online 
resources to provide college students with life skills.
Targeting Common Psychological 
Processes among Disorders Is Ideal
Although online resources seem to allow for the most scope in reaching 
students, the type of intervention also matters. Given the diversity of 
student mental health concerns on college campuses (Gallagher, 2011), 
the approach selected for these online interventions would ideally help 
students struggling with a variety of disorders and developmental prob-
lems, by targeting core processes (Biglan, Hayes, & Pistorello, 2008). 
From a Functional Contextual view (Hayes, 1988), although analyzing 
socio-­economic variables (e.g., parents’ level of education) could help 
identify students who may be more vulnerable to dropout (e.g., Bui, 
2002), these are not student characteristics that can be readily changed, 
particularly not through psychological means. Instead, it seems useful to 
identify processes that can be impacted through counseling, and that 
can help students better adjust to the university setting (Ramos-­Sanchez 
& Nichols, 2007)—­psychological flexibility, as addressed through 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & 
Wilson, 2011), appears to be one such target.
The purpose of this chapter is two-­fold: 1) to describe the develop-
ment and use of podcasts, based on ACT, with college students in 
Australia and 2) to present some preliminary data, along with lessons 
learned, on the impact of these podcasts (after translation) in Italy.

Six Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT) Conversations: 
Teaching Psychological Flexibility 
through Podcasts
In 2005, the Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering School at RMIT 
University,3 Australia, invited the university’s CCC to provide freshman 
students with a series of four two-­hour tutorials to enhance their emo-
tional intelligence skills. The teaching faculty considered that enhancing 
these skills would further two important objectives: 1) increasing stu-
dents’ engagement with the academic programs in the short term, and 2) 
building their long-­term capability to work in teams, which is a crucial 
context for the work of engineers.
The tutorial sessions covered conventional social and emotional skill 
development topics such as stress management, time management, and 
interpersonal communication skills. Two of these sessions incorporated 
standard ACT (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011) interventions. To 
support these ACT tutorials, a set of six podcasts and associated down-
loadable worksheets entitled “6 ACT Conversations” were developed. 
Students in the Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering first-year 
classes were encouraged, but not obliged, to visit the “6 ACT 
Conversations” web pages (See Figures 1 and 2 for the screenshots).
Dissemination Strategy
The six ACT Conversation podcasts (see “Appendix 8A: Links to 6 
ACT Conversation Podcasts, RMIT University, Australia,” at www 
.newharbinger.com/22225 for links) were initially offered as supplemen-
tary support for learning the ACT skills demonstrated in the tutorials. 
3	 RMIT University is Australia’s largest tertiary institution by student enrollment, 
with a total student population of over 70,000 students including 17,000 studying off-
shore either by distance education or at one of the university’s two Vietnam campuses. 
There are three campuses in Melbourne. The university has a substantial enrollment of 
international students and focuses on technology, design, health sciences, and business 
studies.

================================================================================

However the RMIT University Counseling Service also conceived of this 
project as an experimental foray into offering a service via a new tech-
nology that would increase students’ access to the psychological exper-
tise of the CCC. The dissemination strategy also demanded that the 
program be easily “digested” by the students. This was effected by keeping 
the program in a modular format with an average session duration of 26 
minutes (maximum 40 minutes) and by explaining on the front page of 
the site and at the start of each session that the student could start and 
end anywhere in the program.
Unfortunately, but typical of the financial situation in many CCCs, 
no funding was available to research program utilization or effectiveness, 
and the development of the modules spread across many months. Some 
indication, though, of the need for such a site world-wide was that in the 
first twelve months after completion, the 6 ACT Conversations site was 
accessed more frequently by users outside than inside the university 
(Samulenok, 2008).
Podcast Development
The order of the sessions in 6 ACT Conversations is similar to the 
order of ACT treatment protocols available at the time (e.g., Eifert & 
Forsyth, 2005). A set of six audio e-­learning lessons (podcasts), each one 
accompanied by a variable number of worksheets, were then designed, 
recorded, and uploaded on a specific and dedicated website where they 
can either be listened to online or downloaded to personal and portable 
devices (i.e., laptop, mobile phone, MP3 player). As seen in the figure 1 
screenshot, when the student clicks on any one of these lessons, two tabs 
appear: an Introduction tab that explains the concept, and an Audio/
Worksheets tab where the student can listen to/download a particular 
lesson and print handouts to complete. Figure 2 below shows an example 
of what the student will see after she clicks on the Audio/Worksheet tab. 
Students are then guided to listen to an Introduction and subsequent 
segments, numbered (e.g., Part 1, Part 2) so that students know which 
order to follow.
The content of the examples was specifically directed to college stu-
dents, and particularly to address barriers and obstacles they were likely 

================================================================================

166
to encounter in their studies. For example, right from the introduction to 
the audio program, the student is asked to identify a specific barrier she 
has encountered.

LANGUAGE CREATES CONFLICT
The first session, “Language Creates Conflict,” is the most didactic 
and demonstrates how language and the cognitive processes it relies on 
are often the source of “barriers” or problems. This is paradoxical and 
counterintuitive for many educated people, such as college students, as it 
is their facility with these processes that has often brought them success. 
Without the safety and predictability of the conventional counseling 
environment, exposing individuals to these paradoxes has the potential 
to alienate or disengage them. To counter this risk, the session uses 
humor and a lighter touch with the questions it asks the listener to face: 
“Has it been the case with this barrier, or others like it, that the more 
thoughts you had, the further it seemed you got from a solution? That 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
168
doesn’t make sense, does it?” This session also orients the listener to 
workability and values, in preference to logic or conventional thinking, 
as a criterion for relating to one’s own thoughts.
While the session is largely provided as an explanatory piece, it does 
engage the listener in a simplified and generic version of the “creative 
hopelessness” process (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011). This process is 
used to lay the groundwork for the processes of defusion and acceptance 
that follow (see chapter 3 for a detailed description of ACT processes). 
As these processes are counterintuitive, it is helpful to motivate the lis-
tener to at least consider an alternative to conventional approaches that 
depend on “figuring out” a solution. In this session, the creative hope-
lessness process is initiated by way of two exercises. The first exercise 
requires the listener to simply observe the mind in silence and notice 
that thoughts are constantly present. For the second part of this exercise, 
the listener is instructed to try not to have thoughts. This emphasizes the 
impossibility, or hopelessness, of controlling apparently involuntary cog-
nitive behavior. From that point the listener may be open to or curious 
about another approach. This learning is reinforced at the end of the 
session by instructing a thought suppression exercise from Hayes & 
Smith (2005).
Going back to Giulia, the student we met at the beginning of the 
chapter, this first audio lesson could be helpful to her in a number of 
ways. It could: 1) pique her curiosity and prompt her to listen to the rest 
of the program; 2) help her identify as a barrier the thought “I won’t 
waste my efforts anymore in classes. It was unfair that I lost my credits” 
as a precursor for doing something different in her life; 3) lead her to 
notice how many stories her mind is telling her about this event and its 
consequences; and 4) help her find some self-­compassion, given the pod-
cast’s explanation about how this “mind-­y” process is human beings’ 
natural proclivity, deep-­rooted in the history of our evolution.
ACTION AND EXPERIENCE VERSUS THOUGHT 
AND EMOTION
The second session, “Action and Experience Versus Thought and 
Emotion,” introduces the listener to the primacy of experience and to the 
possibility of relating to thoughts in a way that may facilitate more direct 

================================================================================
Podcasts to Help Students in Australia and Italy
169
contact with experience. In this session, defusion exercises such as 
“Thoughts on the Highway” and “Thank Your Mind” are introduced 
(e.g., Hayes & Smith, 2005). It is also the first session to provide a work-
sheet, in this case, one offering several defusion exercises. The “Thoughts 
on the Highway” exercise is a variant of the “Leaves in a Stream” exer-
cise (Hayes & Smith, 2005) and it involves asking students to imagine 
standing safely on the side of a highway, and putting each rising thought, 
image, emotion, or action urge on one of the vehicles going by.
In response to this podcast, Giulia might deepen her experience of 
how her thoughts and emotions catch her off guard all the time, pro-
foundly influencing her actions. She might start noticing that her 
involvement in university courses was almost completely based on her 
pleasant or unpleasant emotions about the subject matter and the profes-
sors. She might have an “aha” moment when conducting defusion exer-
cises, such as the one that asked her to put all the stories about the 
credits she lost on the screen and then make up many different scenarios, 
like a musical with dances and songs about the stories.
EXPANSION, WILLINGNESS, AND INCLUSION
Following the second session, the stage is set for introducing the idea 
that if logic and clever thinking cannot be relied on to enhance life, an 
alternative—­acceptance and willingness—­is needed.
The third session asks the listener to complete a potentially uncom-
fortable physical exercise as a way of contacting the emotions and 
thoughts commonly arising with the experience of unwillingness. The 
exercise requires the listener to stand upright, but with her legs bent, for 
about sixty seconds. For most people this becomes uncomfortable after 
thirty seconds or so. The podcast then trains the listener in the practice 
of Russ Harris’s (2008) “Expansion” exercise as an alternative to strug-
gling with the discomfort normally associated with unwillingness.
The sitting-­standing exercise tends to elicit positive responses from 
students, and in Giulia’s case it could strengthen her understanding of 
the last session, about how thoughts and emotions can impact actions, by 
having her practice noticing the physical sensations, thoughts, and feel-
ings coming and going during the exercise while trying to expand her 
breath to make room for them.

MINDFULNESS AND BEING PRESENT
The fourth ACT Conversations session, “Mindfulness and Being 
Present,” includes five distinct and fairly conventional mindfulness exer-
cises: “Awareness of Breathing,” “Mindfulness of Thoughts,” “Eating a 
Raisin,” “Walking,” and “Just Sitting.” The slow eating of a raisin is a 
commonly practiced mindfulness exercise. It is generally used, like all 
ACT exercises from the “Contact with the Present” point on the ACT 
Hexaflex (see chapter 3), to give the student the opportunity to contact 
the direct stimulus properties of the experience. ACT practitioners fre-
quently “borrow” mindfulness exercises from spiritual traditions such as 
Buddhism and Hinduism, and this is the case with these five exercises.
Defusion and acceptance are very much ACT processes for dealing 
with struggles as they arise. Therefore exposure to one or two samples of 
these behaviors is often all that is needed for a client to generalize the 
skill to common in vivo experiences.
In Giulia’s situation, the raisin exercise might give her an opportu-
nity to start practicing mindfulness with something tangible. If she was 
having difficulty noticing private events such as thoughts and feelings, 
the raisin exercise might make the concept of mindfulness a little easier 
to understand, given that physical experiences, such as taste and texture, 
may be easier to notice. In the podcast, she would be instructed in this 
session to engage in routine practice of at least one of the other four 
exercises as well. This is intended to enhance the attentional skill of 
mindfulness (Siegel, 2007).
VALUES AND DIRECTION
The fifth session expands this focus on initiating action by asking 
the listener to identify values in several areas of life. This session intro-
duces the notion that “motivation” stems from clarity about values and 
the taking of even very small steps in support of them. The work the 
listener is called on to complete is supported by three worksheets, “Values 
Inquiry,” “Achievements, Actions and Values,” and an ACT “classic” 
exercise in which the individual is invited to imagine her funeral.
What could happen to Giulia in this session? Through various values 
training exercises, Giulia might be able to start discriminating the differ-
ence between “going through the motions” of getting a degree versus 

================================================================================
Podcasts to Help Students in Australia and Italy
171
being engaged and full of vitality in the process. Sometimes, a student is 
not aware of how “stale” life gets when a valued direction is not being 
followed, until she is able to notice the difference, based on actual expe-
rience. While working on the first part of the “Achievements, Actions 
and Values” worksheet, she might remember how involved and enthusi-
astic she had felt at the beginning of her first year while writing a paper 
on a topic of great interest to her. She might have a glimpse of how scary 
it is to acknowledge, even to herself, that she cares about her studies, lest 
she be disappointed again. This could open the door toward re-engage-
ment in school for Giulia.
COMMITTED ACTION
The final session, “Committed Action,” shifts the listener’s focus 
from internal cognitive and emotional processes to contacting the chal-
lenges and joys of planning and initiating actions based on values. This 
session and the accompanying worksheets are perhaps most like those 
one might find in a non-­ACT program (e.g., Nelson & Low, 2003; Covey, 
1998). It is important to acknowledge here that there is no specific 
podcast addressing the fourth point on the Hexaflex, Self as Context 
(see chapter 3). Nonetheless, it is addressed in some of the exercises, 
especially “Sit or Stand” (session 3) and “Thoughts on the Highway” 
(session 2), and, at least tangentially, in all of the session 4 exercises. For 
example, the “Sit or Stand” exercise in the third session draws the lis-
tener’s attention simultaneously to the content of her thoughts and to 
her act of choice in the moment of either sitting or standing. By implica-
tion, there is a self who chooses and a self who is aware of the thoughts 
passing by.
For Giulia, this stage could mark a shift toward behaving differently. 
Completing the worksheet would require her to write her purposes in the 
academic values area (see worksheet in Figure 3). She would have the 
opportunity to notice what shows up for her while setting her goals for 
her lifetime, next year, next month, next week, and today. In the work-
sheet, “Barriers and Counter-­Strategies,” she would have an opportunity 
to write down scary feelings and thoughts as possible barriers and the 
defusion and acceptance strategies to use in this case (see worksheet in 
Figure 4).

Giulia is a prototype of the kind of student we wanted to reach with 
the ACT podcast training. She was experiencing external and internal 
barriers to her course of study, and because in that moment she was 
blaming others and generalizing the lack of trust to all university ser-
vices, she was unlikely to seek help at the CCC. Giulia’s story is similar 
to that of many students we interviewed after the podcasts’s deployment, 
who found it a useful resource when facing distressing internal and exter-
nal experiences that made them think of dropping out of college. In the 
next section, we will review the results of a study utilizing this set of 
podcasts, after a brief discussion about the challenges of translating this 
type of material.
The Process of Translating the ACT 
Podcasts from English to Italian
Although ACT is an empirically supported treatment, “no one has yet 
developed an adequate model of how to modify empirically supported 
treatments to deal with the vast differences between human beings in 
areas of culture…religion, class, age, personality, and so on” (Hayes, 
Muto, & Masuda, 2011, p. 236). In non-­technical terms, we approached 
translation knowing that preserving the function of different exercises, 
as we migrated from English/Australia to Italian/Italy, was crucial. Thus, 
the question leading the translation process was: “How do we talk about 
this model and influence the behavior of the Italian students listening to 
these podcasts, in a way functionally equivalent to the original version?” 
This was accomplished by selecting functionally equivalent words that 
were easily understandable and did not elicit aversive reactions in the 
target population.
For example, in the Italian verbal community, the word “values” has 
unwanted religious connotations, while for other verbal communities it 
works perfectly. Moreover, in some contexts the word “acceptance” in 
Italian would be functionally equivalent to “giving up” or “being passive 
or oppressed.” In the case of Giulia, a student listening to a podcast at 
home by herself, the nuance of even a single word might make a differ-
ence between continuing to listen to the podcast or turning it off. 
Therefore, we opted to translate “acceptance” as “expansion” or 

================================================================================

173
“willingness.” Furthermore, since in Italian there is not a specific word 
for mindfulness (consapevolezza = “awareness”), the English word was 
used, with a brief introduction on the meaning and function of the word 
in this context. Finally, special attention was given to the verb “to feel,” 
which in Italian (sentire) also means “to hear.” This double meaning 
could interfere with the function of a mindfulness exercise (e.g., driving 
the attention to the speaker’s voice and not to the stimuli of interest).
Fortunately, the translation of the first two ACT books in Italian 
(Harris, 2008; Hayes & Smith, 2005) co-­occurred with the translation 
of these podcasts, and this helped establish guidelines for the use of a 
functional language for mindfulness-­based materials within the Italian 
community. Readers who are considering translating materials, particu-
larly mindfulness ones based on audio such as those discussed here, are 
encouraged to proceed with caution.

Empirical Considerations: 
Preliminary Data of the ACT 
Web-­Based Podcast Program 
Applied with Italian Students
After the six podcasts based on ACT developed by RMIT University in 
Australia were translated into Italian and adapted for delivery at the 
IULM University in Milan, Italy, they were systematically evaluated in a 
controlled study (Prevedini, Pozzi, Miselli, Rabitti, & Moderato 2012). A 
second set of six audio e-learning lessons and worksheets was also devel-
oped, based on popular Cognitive Behavior Therapy self-­help books on 
different topics (e.g., Rovetto, 1990; Ellis, 1990; Anchisi & Gambotto 
Dessy, 1995; Ramirez Basco, 2010); the relevance and quality of fit for 
the target population was supervised by an expert CBT-trained 
psychotherapist.

================================================================================

There were some substantial differences between the ACT-­based 
and the CBT-­based set of podcasts in the content included (both in 
terms of processes and reliance on experiential exercises) and in the use 
of language. An in-­depth analysis of the different processes in ACT and 
CBT is beyond the scope of this chapter, but suffice it to say that the 
emphasis in ACT experiential exercises was on helping the student 
regain contact with the direct contingencies and shaping new functions 
of behaviors, while the CBT-­based one was focused on fostering more 
rule and verbally directed behavior. The ACT podcasts walk through the 
six processes (see chapter 3) and try to lead the listener to recognize the 
side effects of language and to gain some detachment and relief from the 
power of language, basing actions on values-­based choices instead, while 
the CBT-­based podcasts offer psychoeducational strategies and reinforce 
the process of rule-governed behavior, aiming at establishing a new and 
more functional set of verbal rules (Törneke, 2010).
Between October 2010 and May 2011, 207 students of three different 
courses at IULM University of Milan completed the pre-­ and post-­
intervention assessments. The classes of students were randomly assigned 
to the three conditions (ACT, CBT, and no intervention). In order to 
ensure a good rate of participation, students in the experimental groups 
were offered the equivalent of extra credit for participation.
Participants completed questionnaires on psychological distress, 
anxiety, psychological flexibility, values success, mindfulness, and aca-
demic and study behaviors at pre-­ and post-­training.
Acceptability Ratings
As illustrated in Table 1 below, students in the ACT condition (n = 
56) indicated moderately satisfactory ratings with the ACT audio 
e-­learning program. On a 5-­point Likert-­like scale (0-­Not at all, 5-­very 
much), most students gave a rating to the ACT podcasts of 3 or above in 
terms of having learned something useful (86%), thinking the content 
was relevant to college students (88%), and believing the podcast format 
was practical (91%). Similar percentages were reported by students 
assigned to the CBT condition. Finally, more than 80% of the students 
in both groups reported that they would recommend the program to a 
friend.

nificant condition differences emerged in terms of changes in psychologi-
cal flexibility and mindfulness.
The results showed a significant main effect from pre-­ to post-­
training in worry and values consistency scores, but no interaction (con-
dition) effect emerged. Both the ACT-­based and the CBT-­based groups 
reported having less pathological worry and acting more consistently 
with their values at the end of the term. The no-­intervention control 
group always changed in the opposite direction from the two interven-
tion groups, making it more likely that positive effects could be attrib-
uted to the ACT-­ and the CBT-­based podcast interventions. There was 
no significant effect on psychological distress, except for an interaction 
effect on a phobic anxiety subscale, which typically assesses fear and 
avoidance responses and escape behaviors, with scale scores increasing 
from pre-­ to post-­training assessment in the CBT-­based and control 
groups, and decreasing in the ACT-­based podcast group.
Importantly, analyses of the academic and study behaviors question-
naire showed that the CBT-­based podcast group mostly did not change 
and the control group showed significant changes in the undesired direc-
tion from pre-­ to post-­training, whereas the ACT group reported greater 
academic engagement (e.g., less reading/texting during classes). See

There were several limitations to the study and to the study design, 
such as assigning classrooms (and not students) to condition, not having 
follow-­up data, and collecting data via both paper-­and-­pencil and 
computer-­based venues.
Final Words
Podcasts may be an option for delivering mindfulness and acceptance-­
based content to a wide number of college students with relatively low 
costs. The majority of students reported finding the themes relevant to 
college students and claimed that they were helped by listening to the 
podcasts. The percentage of students listening to the ACT-­based podcast 
who found it relevant and useful was comparable to those exposed to 
more traditional CBT-­based podcasts. The great majority of students in 
both intervention groups also reported that they would suggest it to a 
friend.
However, CCCs considering adding podcasts to their resource list 
may do well to consider the quality of the product they may be able to 
develop, as this will be the primary cost of having such a resource, and 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
180
how much they care about tracking usage by students. We found that the 
quality of the product, not just in terms of content but also production, is 
important. At post-­training assessments, many Italian students involved 
in the research in both groups pointed out that the intonation of the nar-
rating voice was perceived as boring and monotonous. For economic 
reasons, the Italian podcasts were not recorded by a professional speaker 
or recorded with high quality equipment.
In our study, both groups completed a brief evaluation of the pod-
casts’ content (10 true or false questions) as a check on whether students 
actually completed the audio and worksheet material. Only students who 
correctly answered 70% of the questions were included in the experi-
mental groups and had their data analyzed. However, we were not able to 
monitor specific program usage; we were only able to determine that all 
the students included in the study did register on the podcast platform 
and either played or downloaded all the materials. Unfortunately, the 
advantage of the podcast format in being downloaded to any personal 
portable device also carries the disadvantage of making it difficult to 
monitor actual usage. Unless a system similar to the one set up during 
our study is implemented (e.g., sign-­in required, post-­training quiz), most 
schools might be restricted to gauging podcast use by tracking hits on 
their website and/or knowing how many students have downloaded their 
podcasts. Although requiring a sign-­in might help with tracking usage, it 
would also introduce a step that might deter students from actually uti-
lizing these resources.
The most compelling data from this study, and one likely to be useful 
in illustrating the relevance of acceptance and mindfulness to possibly 
increasing student retention, is that students reported significantly higher 
engagement in their academic activities in the ACT condition. This 
matches recent findings from two ACT online programs. One highly 
interactive multimedia online program, targeting values training and 
acceptance, showed significant between-group differences in terms of an 
increase in both intrinsic/positive motivation toward education and 
success in living out education-­related values (Levin, Pistorello, Seeley, 
& Hayes, 2012). The other study, described in detail in chapter 9, found 
that a brief online values training was associated with same-­semester 
increases in academic performance (Chase, 2010).

andra has just started her first semester in college. Her parents 
have long stressed the importance of her attending college. Since 
most of her friends also attend college, it seems like “the thing to

major and doesn’t seem to be passionate about any particular career path.
Sandra is not alone. Most academic advisors have interacted with 
students just like Sandra. What is one to do in such a situation? The 
current chapter is designed to offer potential solutions for these types of 
students. The values exploration and goal-­setting procedures discussed 
herein are based on a recent study that demonstrated a significant 
increase in cumulative GPAs as well as student retention among under-
graduate psychology majors at a medium-size public institution (Chase, 
2010). The system consisted of a series of text-­ and audio-­based modules 
designed to encourage students to think about why they are pursuing a 
college education, what they value in an education, and how to set goals

that will facilitate their progression toward graduation. The brief, web-­
based nature of the system offers many practical advantages in terms of 
dissemination and cost-­benefit analyses and will be discussed in more 
detail in the following pages.
The Problem of Student Retention
College student retention is a critical issue in higher education that is 
practically, institutionally, and socially important. The following section 
explores the multitude of factors that contribute to the problem of student 
retention in the student’s social and academic life.
The Advantages of a College Education
When compared to those without college degrees, college graduates 
typically enjoy more employment opportunities, including more chances 
for advancement and higher salaries (Dohm & Wyatt, 2002). For 
example, in the last quarter of 2009, college graduates with full-time jobs 
earned a median weekly salary of $1,121 compared to $638 for high 
school graduates and $449 for those who did not graduate from high 
school (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics News Release, 2010). In addition, 
college graduates can expect to earn an average of $2.1 million over their 
lifetime, compared with $1.2 million for high school graduates. 
Furthermore, those with Master’s degrees can expect to earn approxi-
mately $2.5 million over their lifetime compared to $3.4 million for those 
with Doctoral degrees (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). Although the educa-
tional process is time consuming, these statistics indicate a substantial 
return on the investment in terms of earnings, not to mention the social 
and cultural accolades generally given to those with college degrees.
Student Retention as a 
University Problem
Given the documented benefits of a college degree, one would expect 
high retention rates in our universities, but this doesn’t seem to be the 

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting
185
case. According to the U.S. Department of Education (2007), approxi-
mately 35% of students coming into public four-­year institutions do not 
obtain a degree. In addition, only 47% of students entering four-­year 
institutions complete their degree within six years. For public institu-
tions, this rate drops to a mere 41% of students, and only 34% complete 
their degrees in four years (Astin, Tsui, & Avalos, 1996).
Insufficient University Resources 
Devoted to Student Retention
It is surprising to find that many colleges and universities lack suffi-
cient resources directed toward student retention (e.g., Hood, 1999; 
McLaughlin, Brozovsky, & McLaughlin, 1998). According to a recent 
survey of administrators at more than 1,000 colleges and universities, 
retention policies have not universally been a top priority for administra-
tors (American College Testing, 2008). Less than half (47%) of the 
administrators in the survey reported any organizational goals related to 
retention efforts of first-­year students and even less (33%) reported any 
goals related to increasing degree completion rates. Lastly, only 52% 
reported having staff members who are specifically responsible for coor-
dinating retention efforts.
Setting Factors Involved in Retention
Considerable resources have been devoted to researching college 
student retention. Vincent Tinto (1993), a prominent retention researcher, 
developed a popular model of retention that conceptualizes institutes of 
higher education as comprised of an academic system and a social system. 
According to the model, an imbalance in either of these two systems is 
positively correlated with student attrition. More specifically, the less a 
student is integrated into the social system (e.g., extracurricular interac-
tions with peers) or the academic system (e.g., attending classes, study-
ing, and faculty interactions), retention becomes less likely. According to 
Tinto, greater goal commitment (e.g., commitment to obtaining a degree) 
and value assessments, along with other contextual factors, impact social, 
academic, and institutional integration and academic performance 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
186
(1993). When students’ campus experiences conflict with previously 
established values, integration may be more challenging (Tinto, 1993).
A good deal of research has also investigated the specific factors at 
the institutional, social, and individual levels that are responsible for uni-
versity student retention (e.g., Berger & Braxton, 1998; Pascarella & 
Terenzini, 2005; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012; Tinto, 1993). As 
a whole, this research attributes retention to a set of historical and situ-
ational factors involving high school performance, socio-­economic 
status, family support, personality traits, the size of the institution, the 
quality and quantity of faculty interactions, and peer relationships (e.g., 
Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012).
From the student’s perspective, however, arriving at college may 
bring with it an amalgam of new responsibilities brought about by the 
increased independence of living away from home. Behaviorally speak-
ing, this new life experience is characterized by a multitude of competing 
contingencies related to peer groups, finances, and extracurricular activ-
ities that may lessen one’s contact with academic contingencies related 
to class attendance, the completion of assignments, and, ultimately, sat-
isfactory academic performance.
It is important that colleges and universities develop effective reten-
tion programs because retention affects the future opportunities of stu-
dents themselves, the financial viability of educational institutions, and 
the competitiveness of the nation as a participant in the global economy. 
The majority of the literature on student retention focuses on student 
finances, advising, student-­faculty interactions, classroom environments, 
stress reduction, and minority status (e.g., Kerkvliet & Nowell, 2005; 
Seidman, 2005; Stover, 2005). Surprisingly, only a few researchers use 
academic performance as an outcome measure in their research (e.g., 
Bowen, Price, Lloyd, & Thomas, 2005; Thomas, 2002).
In addition, research suggests that the students most in need of aca-
demic assistance are the least likely to seek it out. Karabenick and Knapp 
(1988) found that seeking out assistance increased as students’ needs 
went from low to moderate, but dropped substantially as the need grew 
and grades dropped below a C-­ range. One possibility is that increasingly 
more difficult thoughts and feelings, including some self-­stigma perhaps, 
may be associated with seeking out academic assistance when it is truly 
needed.

Gaining Personal Control over Learning
Research suggests that the more students have access to strategies 
that enable them to exert personal control over their learning, the more 
likely they are to be successful in college (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 
1997). However, given the before-­mentioned retention statistics, it is 
likely that many students lack appropriate self-­management skills that 
would enable them to exert control over their own academic success.
Self-­management training has been used in organizational and edu-
cational settings for decades (Luthans & Davis, 1979). Self-­management 
involves recognizing, setting, and monitoring progress toward the com-
pletion of goals, and utilizing reinforcement and punishment to promote 
goal attainment (Frayne, 1991). Though the literature suggests that self-­
management programs directed at academic behavior may have an 
encouraging impact, recent research in the area is lacking (Gerhardt, 
2007). Most research efforts investigate goal setting as part of an inter-
vention package rather than in isolation, leading to mixed conclusions 
on the effectiveness of goal setting separate from other interventions.
Even when the effects of goal setting are specifically studied, the find-
ings are mixed. For example, Loewy and Bailey (2007) found no effect of 
goals when added to an already-­existing system of performance feedback 
for customer service employees in a retail setting. However, Amigo, Smith, 
& Ludwig (2008) found that goal setting increased busing times at a res-
taurant only when coupled with task-­clarification and feedback. In addi-
tion, Goomas, Smith, & Ludwig (2011) found that a combination of goals 
and feedback significantly increased the performance of employees in a 
distribution center. The current chapter describes a method of utilizing 
goal-­setting in the context of values training exercises delivered online to 
promote effective self-­management skills and, subsequently, improved 
student academic performance and retention in a university setting.

Among the simplest types of performance-­improvement interventions is 
goal setting, which is due, in large part, to the work of Edwin Locke and 
Gary Latham. Below we will discuss the specific features that can improve 
the effectiveness of goal setting.

Seven Characteristics of Effective 
Goal Setting
Most goal-­setting research focuses on the relationship between an 
individual’s goals and performance. According to Locke, Shaw, Saari, 
and Latham (1981), an effective goal-­setting program includes seven 
characteristics: (a) challenging goals, (b) specific goals, (c) the ability to 
change one’s own performance, (d) feedback on goal progress, (e) mon-
etary reinforcement for goal attainment, (f) a supportive supervisor (e.g., 
an academic mentor), and (g) goal acceptance.
Locke and Latham (1990) suggest that challenging and specific goals 
motivate individuals to achieve goals based on choice, effort, and persis-
tence. The more specific a goal can be, the easier it is for an individual to 
choose appropriate actions to take toward goal attainment and exclude 
those actions that may interfere with the goal. When specific goals are 
made to be somewhat challenging, this motivates the individual to exert 
effort and adjust that effort appropriately on the way to meeting the goal. 
Finally, specific goals tend to promote persistence through the steps 
needed in obtaining the goal.
Locke and Latham (2002) also suggest that performance toward 
goals is influenced by personal commitment, feedback on goal attainment, 
and task complexity. The importance that an individual gives a goal, as 
well as an individual’s self-­efficacy, affects one’s personal commitment to 
a goal (see also Bandura, 1997). Feedback is useful because it facilitates 
an individual’s ability to track his progress toward goal completion and 
adjust his behavior accordingly. Lastly, task complexity relates directly to 
the complexity of repertoire needed to achieve a particular goal in terms 
of skill sets.
Unfortunately, students sometimes have a problem using goal setting, 
precisely for some of the reasons Locke and Latham mention: they are 
not clear that this is a choice and they are not truly committed to the 
outcomes. Role expectations may have brought the student into higher 
education and he has not thought sufficiently about what his education 
is really about. For that reason, we began to explore whether goal setting 
could be augmented by work on values.

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting

Values Training for Students
Values training has a long and complicated history in education and has 
been defined in a multitude of ways. Modern work from a behavioral 
perspective in the form of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; 
Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011) makes it easier to conduct values work 
and to combine it with goal setting.
Values Education: Empirical Research
Values training procedures gained popularity in the late 1960s fueled 
by a seminal text by Simon, Howe, and Kirschenbaum (1972) on the 
subject, and have typically emerged in the areas of moral and character 
education which focus on teaching basic values that are seen as “good” 
by society (Easterbrooks & Scheetz, 2004). This type of values training 
generally follows the same procedure, wherein a group discussion format 
is used to encourage people to discuss moral issues and their underlying 
values. For example, Mosconi and Emmett (2003) implemented a four-­
part values training curriculum with 54 high school students, where stu-
dents were asked to contemplate their own values, defend their values in 
a dialogue with their peers, and engage in discussion, group work, and 
journaling. This procedure tended to modify students’ perceptions of 
success from an initial society-­based materialistic definition to defini-
tions more in line with the activities themselves. Recent laboratory 
studies with 7th graders showed that African-­American students who 
were instructed to write about a high-­ranked value, as opposed to a low-­
ranked value, reported a lessened experience of feeling stereotyped and 
significantly improved their grades—­reducing the racial achievement 
gap by 40% (Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, & Master, 2006).
Values training appears to have a salutary impact on college students 
as well. Ohlde and Vinitsky (1976) examined the effects of a 7-­hour 
values training procedure in undecided college undergraduates. Their 
method involved small-group activities where students expressed their 
values to one another, outlined action plans, and identified barriers to 

================================================================================

190
action; this intervention produced significantly greater value awareness 
than a control condition. In a recent laboratory study, undergraduate 
students were randomly assigned to give a speech about either a top-­
ranked or lowest-­ranked valued outcome. Results showed that partici-
pants who gave a speech on a more valued outcome had lower salivary 
cortisol responses to stress tasks, relative to control participants (Creswell, 
Welch, Taylor, Sherman, Gruenewald, & Mann, 2005). Salivary cortisol 
is considered a measure of stress, and when consistently high for extended 
periods of time, may result in decreased resilience and higher vulnerabil-
ity to chronic mental and physical problems (McEwen, 1998).
In order to mix values work with goal setting as part of a behavioral 
intervention, a clear understanding of the principles involved is neces-
sary. We have found it helpful to consider these topics from the point of 
view of Relational Frame Theory (RFT; Hayes, Barnes-­Holmes, & 
Roche, 2001).
Goal Setting, Values, and Relational 
Frame Theory (RFT)
RFT is an empirically validated theory of language and cognition 
developed from a behavior analytic perspective, which offers a novel 
account of goal setting and values (Hayes et al., 2001; O’Hora & Maglieri, 
2006). RFT is based on the idea that humans learn to derive relations 
among stimuli and to bring that ability under the control of arbitrary 
cues. A simple example is the relationship between a dime and a nickel. 
Young children prefer the nickel because it is larger, but when their verbal 
abilities improve, they prefer a dime because it is said to be “more than” 
a nickel.
A goal statement functions as a rule that establishes a set of verbal 
relations between behavior and specified consequences (Hayes & Hayes, 
1989; O’Hora & Maglieri, 2006). The ability to derive relations between 
performance and the goal (e.g., “I am not going to reach the goal”) allows 
the individual to adjust behavior accordingly and to contact reinforce-
ment (“I’m going to make it”) in the absence of tangible consequences 
(O’Hora & Maglieri, 2006). In RFT terms, goal setting is a kind of 
“track.”

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting
191
From an ACT perspective, values are not just a matter of classical 
values clarification: rather they are a combination of the choice of quali-
ties of action and an orientation toward the present. Values in ACT are 
“freely chosen, verbally constructed consequences of ongoing, dynamic, 
evolving patterns of activity, which establish predominant reinforcers for 
that activity that are intrinsic in engagement in the valued behavioral 
pattern itself” (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009, p. 66). Goals are tangible con-
sequences that can be achieved and finished. Conversely, values estab-
lish qualities of ongoing patterns of action as reinforcers –­ they can be 
instantiated but not obtained like an object. In other words, values are a 
verbal establishing stimulus, or in RFT terms, an “augmental,” and the 
qualities that they establish as reinforcers can fit with concrete goals, but 
cannot be reduced to them because they are ongoing.
For example, suppose a student values learning. Studying for a test 
could have a goal of getting a good grade and passing a course, in which 
case the goal is reached and finished, but if it also has the value of learn-
ing, learning can continue. Even if nobody knew what the student was 
doing, actions such as reading or paying attention might now have prop-
erties that are intrinsically reinforcing.
Values work appears to be a crucial component in ACT. For example, 
a recent pain study showed that adding values training increased the 
effectiveness of an acceptance component for pain tolerance when com-
pared to acceptance alone or control conditions (Branstetter-­Rost, 
Cushing, & Douleh, 2009). A review of ACT components confirmed the 
utility of values interventions on their own or added as a component 
(Levin, Hildebrandt, Lillis, & Hayes, 2012).
Goal-­Directed Behavior in the 
Service of Values
The addition of values to goal-­setting may help address a gap in the 
goal-­setting literature. Successful goals are more likely to be obtained 
when those goals are tied to something an individual values (Sheldon & 
Elliot, 1999; Sheldon & Houser-­Marko, 2001; Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & 
Kasser, 2004). Values may help overcome the known failure of goal 
setting to ensure that progress will be maintained in the face of obstacles 
(Gollwitzer & Brandstatter, 1997).

================================================================================

No study has yet explored the impact of adding an ACT values inter-
vention to goal-­setting training in increasing student retention in college. 
In order to do this, ACT values work needs to be delivered en masse in a 
cost effective way, such as through an online venue. The aim of this chapter 
is to provide an overview of ways in which this might be accomplished.
Building Online Modules
Below, we will describe a set of online modules that incorporate an ACT-­
based values training for college students, as well as best practices in 
terms of goal setting. These modules are designed to prompt students to 
think about what they value in their college education and to create 
academic goals that are in line with their stated values.
The Academic Values Module
Several factors need to be considered when designing an online 
values program.
HOW TO GET STUDENTS TO REFLECT ON 
AND WRITE ABOUT THEIR LIFE VALUES
When designing a values module, one is initially struck with the 
problem of how to get a student to clarify “freely chosen” values while at 
the same time not imposing particular values on the student. After all, 
from an ACT perspective, values work is meant to function as an aug-
mental (establishing reinforcers) in order to promote “tracking” on the 
part of the student (i.e., sensitizing the student to how behavior is values-­
based). This is explicitly opposed to “pliance” (i.e., behavior governed by 
a socially-­mediated rule imposed by others; Hayes et al., 2011).
Let’s think back on Sandra, the undecided student described at the 
beginning of this chapter. It is important that the academic values 
module not imply that she should value education. Rather, the module 
would instead discuss what values are and are not, interspersed with 
examples tied to an academic setting, thus empowering Sandra to choose 

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting
193
her values (See the “Thinking and writing about values” screenshot in 
Appendix 9A [www.newharbinger.com/22225]).
The module incorporated a “Tending the Garden” metaphor in an 
effort to have the student experientially understand the process of 
valuing by having the student imagine he is a gardener who values his 
task even though droughts, floods, pests, and other obstacles may inter-
fere with the quality of the crops. Even so, the gardener can find some-
thing in the act itself that he values. Values are about the process rather 
than the concrete outcomes (See the “Tending the Garden” metaphor 
screenshot in Appendix 9B.) The module concludes with open-­ended 
questions in which the student can freely state his values. However, this 
component is worded in such a way that the student is asked to think 
about his values as they relate to education. In other words, the student 
is asked to find a way to link education to life values that he freely 
chooses.
COMMUNICATING WHAT VALUES ARE 
AND ARE NOT
The academic values module starts by discussing what values are 
and what they are not, without using overly technical terms. For example, 
we discuss values as “areas of life that have meaning to you” and empha-
size that, unlike achieving a goal, valuing choices are ongoing. We found 
it useful to discuss values as a direction in life. Values are like a direction 
on a roadmap, with particular stops along the way (e.g., college, visiting 
family, a particular job), but the trip never ends (See the “What are 
values?” screenshot in Appendix 9C.)
Four other points about values are emphasized. First, values are choices. 
Values are not right or wrong. If the student were alone on an island and 
nobody would know what he valued, what would he choose? Second, 
values help a person be present in what he is doing: walking to campus, 
having a conversation with a roommate, or studying for an exam. Once 
someone has stated his own values, it becomes easier to monitor the cor-
respondence between the value and one’s own behavior. Third, values help 
orient a person to a life direction yet allow for flexibility in how one travels 
along the direction. This means that “valuing” can take a variety of 
forms. For example, “learning” is not restricted to a school setting –­ one 
can “learn” from any life situation. Fourth, one does not have to have 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
194
experience with a particular situation in order for it to be values-­based. Future 
goals such as “graduation” can still be linked to chosen qualities of action.
Next, the module describes what values are not through four addi-
tional points. First, values are not outcomes or achievements. These refer to 
goals, not values. Values refer to a life direction and can be demonstrated 
but not fully achieved or finished. However, clarifying one’s own values 
may reveal particular goals that are aligned with one’s values. Second, 
values are not feelings. Many times, engaging in activities aligned with 
particular values bring happiness. However, many times these activities 
bring about discomfort and pain (e.g., a long-­term relationship is often-
times accompanied by discomfort and conflict). The third and fourth 
points relate to other people. Specifically, the third point emphasizes that 
values are not just about pleasing others; although pleasing others may arise 
from living in a valued direction, it is also important that a student is 
valuing a direction because it matters to him to do so. Engaging in 
behaviors out of guilt or to please others results in less desirable psycho-
logical outcomes (e.g., Sheldon et al., 2004). This point helps distinguish 
values as augmentals from pliance. The fourth point is that values are not 
assertions about what others must do. Emphasized here is the fact that we 
are discussing personal values, which pertain to one’s own behavior, not 
the behavior of other people.
The Academic Goal-­Setting Module
The academic goal-­setting module consists of text and audio that 
discuss what goals are, how they might relate to education, and how to 
set them, and concludes with several open-­ended questions designed to 
prompt the student to think about and state goals related to his educa-
tional career at the university. Most importantly, the goal-­setting module 
comes after the values training module, thus goals are set to be aligned 
with the education-­related values the student set previously.
HOW TO SET SMART GOALS
The module focuses on setting SMART (Specific, Measureable, 
Attainable, Realistic, and Time-­oriented) goals (Nelson & Quick, 2006). 
During the open-­ended section of the module, the student is prompted 

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting
195
to set academic goals and state how each element of SMART relates to 
his goal. Specific means the goal is a clear and specific statement of what 
the student wants. It is emphasized here that when a target goal is vague, 
one can confuse oneself, give up, or go after the wrong goal. Measurable 
refers to setting goals in a way that the student can easily track his own 
progress toward completion. The more measureable a goal is, the more 
readily a student can recognize if he is moving in the right direction, 
gauge how far he needs to go to meet the goal, and adjust his behavior 
accordingly. It is also emphasized that a measureable goal is typically also 
a specific goal that articulates actions that the student can take to 
achieve the overall objective. Attainable means the goal should be achiev-
able, but not easy. We recommend using an 80% probability of goal 
achievement for short-­term goals, while long-­term goals can be more dif-
ficult. Realistic is closely related to Attainable but also means that the 
actions associated with goal obtainment are behaviors that the student 
can actually do given his life situation. For example, it may not be realis-
tic for the student to read 200 pages every day given that the student may 
also work, have four other classes to attend, and so on. Lastly, the term 
Time-­oriented refers to setting clear deadlines for goals. It also emphasizes 
that setting goals that have natural endings (e.g., the end of the day, 
week, month, or semester) can be particularly useful in maintaining 
focus and motivation toward goal obtainment (see the “SMART Goals” 
and “Writing SMART Goals” screenshots in Appendix D).
SETTING PROXIMAL, INTERMEDIATE, 
AND DISTAL GOALS
SMART goal setting comes with one caveat, however. SMART 
goals are generally meant to apply only to short-­term (e.g., end of the 
week) and intermediate goals (e.g., end of the semester). Long-­term or 
distal goals (e.g., 2-­3 years) help students not lose sight of “the big picture.” 
In this case, the big picture could be “graduation.” At this point, it is OK 
for the student to set long-­term goals even if he has no idea how to get 
there. As the student progresses toward achieving the long-­term goal, it 
becomes easier for him to determine how to achieve it with short-­term 
and intermediate SMART goals.
After the student indicates his goals in the module, he is then 
prompted to write out the potential obstacles to achieving the goals as 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
196
well as possible solutions for each obstacle. Then, the student indicates 
why the goal(s) is/are important to him, which serves to further link the 
goal(s) to his previously stated values. Lastly, the student provides spe-
cific action steps on the way to achieving his ultimate goal, and when 
these steps should be completed.
SELF-­MONITORING WITH THE 
GOAL-­SETTING CALENDAR
When implementing a goal-­setting training for students, it may be 
useful to have students generate a goal-­setting calendar. The calendar 
serves as a self-­monitoring tool for the student in which he sets deadlines 
for each of his goals, listing specific actions and potential obstacles to 
meeting his goals. The student may also be encouraged to write impor-
tant academic deadlines on the calendar (e.g., due dates for class assign-
ments and exams) that may help him gauge the Time-­oriented aspect of 
his SMART goals.
Empirical Considerations
The current chapter is based on a recent dissertation by Chase (2010). 
The purpose of this study was to assess the additive effects of values 
training to an online goal-­setting training procedure on academic per-
formance and student retention. Psychology majors in their second year 
or beyond were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups: 
a goal-­setting training only group (n = 48), a goal-­setting plus values 
training group (n = 51), and a waitlist control group (n = 33). The 
modules were constructed using an online survey management system 
and consisted of text with an audio component consisting of a voice 
speaking the words on the page. Each part of the module ended with 
multiple-choice questions to ensure that students were retaining the 
information in the module. Goal setting alone was not effective, but 
when the values module was added to goal setting there were statistically 
significant improvements in cumulative grade point average (GPA) as 
well as in student retention (i.e., students in the goal-­setting plus values 
condition were significantly more likely to continue their enrollment in 
the university the next semester). In the subsequent semester, the impact 

================================================================================
Web-­Based Values Training and Goal Setting
197
of goal setting plus values on GPA was not maintained; however, when 
values work was added to the waitlist condition, GPA again increased, 
thus replicating the positive impact of values training. This indicates 
that these short modules had medium-­term effects over a semester, but 
not long-­term effects. Thus, future research should investigate ways to 
maintain the effects.
Final Words
There are a few issues to consider when implementing values training 
with college students. In creating the current set of values modules, the 
challenge of not “telling students what to value” quickly became appar-
ent, and a good deal of effort went into preventing this from happening. 
With any values procedure based on an ACT conceptualization, it is 
important to prevent subtle communications that could control the stu-
dent’s behavior via pliance. The aim of values training is to have the 
student generate his own value statements, which will lead to him track-
ing the correspondence between his behavior in relation to his previously 
stated values. The crucial feature of tracking is that it sensitizes the indi-
vidual’s behavior to the environment such that he may self-­regulate his 
behavior in the service of his own values. If such values are imposed on 
the student by another person, then the student may focus his efforts on 
avoiding aversive consequences from another person or authority figure 
rather than tracking the correspondence between his or her behavior 
and the valued direction. Tracking places the individual’s behavior under 
the influence of the natural consequences of the behavior. In this 
context, behavior is in the service of values. Values choices cannot be 
turned over to other people.
The challenge, then, was to create a situation in which students 
could freely state their values while at the same time guiding the stu-
dents’ values statements to focus on their college career. As mentioned 
previously, the modules guided the student’s focus by interspersing exam-
ples of values and behavior related to academic settings while not impos-
ing judgments on any particular value or behavior. At the end of the 
values module, the student was asked to think about his current college 
situation and everything it entails, both pleasant and unpleasant. Then, 
the student was asked to try and find something in that situation that 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
198
mattered to him and to try to link that to larger life values. Thus, instead 
of telling the student to value “education” or “learning,” the student was 
asked to try and link his college experience to larger life values. The 
student is the one who chooses his own values, not the administrator 
conducting the training.
Since students are free to decide for themselves what they value, 
they are also free to decide what they do not value. As briefly mentioned 
by Herbst and Houmanfar (2009, p. 65), one should be prepared for the 
possibility that some individuals may come to realize that their values do 
not align with a particular domain—in this case, a college education. 
While at first glance this may be seen as troublesome, values in-­and-­of 
themselves are neither “good” nor “bad” in any absolute sense. Although 
an individual without a college education may not make as much money 
as an individual with a college education (as discussed at the beginning 
of this chapter), there is nothing inherently “good” or “bad” about having 
a particular level of income. If a student goes through a values training 
exercise and discovers that a college education is not in the service of his 
values, the student would likely not be happy continuing in that particu-
lar life direction and was likely doing so out of pliance (e.g., pressure from 
parents or peers) and not because he truly valued doing so.
In conclusion, the issue of student retention in our nation’s universi-
ties is real and university administrators seem to be lacking the resources 
needed to address it. The preceding paragraphs outlined one possible 
solution. The online values training and choice module, added to a goal-­
setting training package, discussed herein has been shown to increase 
cumulative GPA and student retention during that term among psychol-
ogy students at a public university. The online and automated nature of 
the package is a format that is amenable to dissemination across a wide 
number of colleges and universities across the world. Although the effects 
produced by the training package were shown to be medium-­term and 
not permanent, this is not surprising. Values are continuously evolving 
and need to be revisited throughout life. There is no reason institutions 
of higher education could not structure regular exploration of values 
choices in students. The effects are encouraging and warrant the contin-
ued development and evolution of the technology for future 
implementation.

Teaching Mindfulness and 
Acceptance within College 
Communities to Enhance 
Peer Support

t’s 2 a.m. and Nathan is sitting at his desk, trying to memorize for-
mulas for his Calculus test tomorrow morning. His phone vibrates 
with another text from Emily, his ex-­girlfriend who lives across 
campus. He knows she’s been having a hard time since they broke up and 
he’s tried to be supportive, but she just doesn’t seem to be able to move 
on with her life. This text is even more concerning than the one he 
received 20 minutes ago; she feels helpless, she’s tired of the constant 
pain, and she just cut herself to make the pain stop. Nathan’s feelings of 
frustration and helplessness mount. What should he say to her? What 
should he do? It’s not the first time Emily has hurt herself. In fact, her 
self-­harm was one of the main reasons Nathan had broken off the rela-
tionship. He couldn’t understand why she’d hurt herself when she was 
upset and he struggled with keeping her self-­harm a secret, as Emily had 
insisted. He’d tried to get her to agree to go to the college counseling 
center (CCC) but Emily angrily refused, saying that she wasn’t crazy and 
could manage things on her own. Nathan’s friends have told him he 
should stop talking to Emily, but he feels she needs him now more than 

================================================================================

204
ever. Nathan’s afraid that if he doesn’t respond to Emily, she might kill 
herself. He feels lost and overwhelmed in his relationship with Emily.
Emily was devastated when Nathan broke up with her two months 
ago. They had been dating for almost a year and she’d taken great risks 
to open up emotionally in her relationship with him. Nathan had become 
her lifeline in many ways, her family life being chaotic and abusive. She’d 
finally found someone she could trust, someone she could really talk to 
about her issues. He was the first person she’d ever told about her cutting, 
and though he seemed to handle it well, he insisted that she stop hurting 
herself. Emily tried to stop cutting and was successful for a few months 
until a visit home during break when, with her parents in the midst of a 
drunken argument, she cut her shoulder to ease the pain. A week later, 
when Nathan saw the cuts, he gave her an ultimatum: get help at the 
counseling center or the relationship is over.
This scenario and many others like it play out frequently on college 
campuses in the US and throughout the world. Students turn to other 
students for help with significant mental health issues and friends experi-
ence helplessness and frustration in their attempts to provide them with 
support. Significant numbers of students on college campuses struggle 
with mental health issues in isolation, afraid to talk to family or friends 
about their problems, sometimes due to fear of being a burden or because 
they think it means they’re crazy. Many other students share freely of 
their struggles, but refuse to seek professional help because they “don’t 
have time” or “want to solve things on their own” (Eisenberg, Downs, 
Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009). Ultimately, the significant prevalence of 
student mental health issues on college campuses impacts entire campus 
communities, not just those who are directly suffering. Students, func-
tioning in close living and learning environments, are quite aware of 
their peers’ distress, but feel ill equipped and overwhelmed in the face of 
attempting to provide support for their friends (Drum, Brownson, 
Denmark, & Smith, 2009). Fortunately, campus communities can be 
enriched by enhancing mental health awareness and community 
members’ willingness and ability to recognize and connect effectively 
with their peers when they’re in distress.
This chapter will describe one such initiative, a peer support enrich-
ment program, which utilizes a mindfulness- and acceptance-­based 
approach to train college students to help other college students strug-
gling with mental health issues. We will first review relevant literature 

================================================================================

regarding student mental health problems on campus and establish the 
relevance of peer-­based programs. Additionally, we will describe a peer 
support enrichment program and highlight its infusion with mindfulness 
and acceptance processes. This peer support training program, Student 
Support Network (SSN), is available for download as Appendix 10A at 
www.newharbinger.com/22225.
Some studies have estimated that between 30 –­ 50% of college stu-
dents have diagnosable psychiatric disorders (Eisenberg, Gollust, 
Golberstein, & Hefner 2007; Blanco et al., 2008), while in annual surveys 
over half of college students report feeling overwhelming anxiety and 
31% feeling so depressed it’s difficult to function. Of great concern are 
students who are so distressed they are contemplating suicide (6.1%) or 
have made a suicide attempt (1.1%; American College Health Association 
[ACHA], 2011). Drum, Brownson, Denmark, & Smith (2009) examined 
more closely the nature of college student suicidal ideation and found 
that 46% of students with thoughts of ending their life never told anyone 
else, and when they did share their distress, 67% of the time they first 
told a peer. In summary, mental health distress is widespread and college 
students tend to hide their struggles from others, particularly when their 
struggles are more significant and involve suicidal ideation. When stu-
dents do share their struggles, most often this sharing happens first with 
friends.
Typically, easy-­to-­access professional mental health resources are 
available on college campuses; yet, students seem reticent to seek help. 
Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin (2009) sought to detail student 
resistance to help seeking; major reasons included lack of time, lack of 
perceived need for help, unawareness of services or insurance coverage, 
and skepticism about treatment effectiveness. Additional evidence is 
emerging that biomedical descriptions of mental health distress can add 
to stigmatizing attitudes and ultimately decrease potential help-seeking 
behaviors (Rusch, Kanter, & Brondino, 2009). Diagnostic labeling and 
biomedical descriptions of mental health distress, both inherent in a 
medical model conceptualization, may reduce the likelihood that indi-
viduals will access help for mental health distress.
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & 
Wilson, 2011), with its functional/contextual orientation to understand-
ing mental health distress, may provide a compelling alternative to the 
medical model when designing and implementing psychoeducational 

================================================================================

programming intended to enrich support for students within campus 
communities.
College counseling, health, or wellness centers can show initiative 
and assume leadership and responsibility for the strategic design and 
implementation of population-level interventions intended to improve 
overall student support, safety, and well-­being. Many CCCs see them-
selves as more traditional clinical settings, providing professional mental 
health assessment and treatment and occasional training and outreach 
programming within the campus community. Under the weight of ever-
increasing student requests for services (Gallagher, 2011), a call for more 
clinical staff is often the first reaction. But with such widespread preva-
lence of mental health distress on college campuses, no CCC could ever 
be adequately staffed to meet the clinical needs of all students on campus. 
New paradigms of treatment and community intervention need to be 
investigated, developed, and evolved in order to address the overall 
mental health needs of the campus community.
Fortunately, much has been learned over the past decade about 
college campuses adopting public health models for suicide prevention 
and mental health promotion. This work has been largely supported by 
the Garrett Lee Smith Act of Congress in 2004, which under the guid-
ance of the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA) has authorized grants to, as of 2012, 98 dif-
ferent colleges to study and evolve best practices as they relate to suicide 
prevention and mental health promotion on college campuses (Suicide 
Prevention Resource Center, 2012). The Act has also funded the cre-
ation of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC), a clearinghouse 
for information and research, and a major provider of technical support 
for college campuses invested in designing and implementing strategic 
initiatives to promote mental health and prevent suicide on college 
campuses.
In light of the widespread prevalence of mental health distress on 
college campuses and the impossibility of providing individual or even 
group support to all these students, CCCs continue to evolve toward 
engaging in local, strategic, population-­based mental health education 
and promotion activities as a central component of their mission on 
campus. While providing leadership for these efforts, CCCs must involve 
the entire campus community in development and implementation of 
such activities. Such efforts will help build trusting connections between

helping resources within campus communities and open up conversa-
tions about mental health issues that can result in less overall mental 
health stigma. This chapter describes one such mindfulness and 
acceptance-­informed approach to building community support for stu-
dents with mental health distress.
Let’s return to Nathan and Emily, the students introduced at the 
beginning of this chapter. Nathan has tried talking to family and friends 
about the situation with Emily and how he feels responsible for her well-­
being. Typically, they’ve tried to be supportive by giving him advice: 
break off the relationship, stop getting sucked into her drama, turn off 
your cell phone, forget about her. All this is meant to make Nathan feel 
better, but in the end he feels guilty about pulling away from Emily and 
to some degree he feels responsible for her pain. He still cares about 
Emily deeply. No one seems to understand this part of his experience.
Emily has lost her best friend in Nathan. They used to spend much 
of their time together and she met most of her friends through Nathan’s 
involvement in the fraternity house. Now that they’re not dating, she 
doesn’t feel comfortable going to the fraternity house and hanging out. 
She’s lost her boyfriend and her social life, all because of cutting. She 
feels that nobody understands her perspective: that the cutting is not 
that big a deal, it’s not like she’s going to kill herself. Emily is lost, alone, 
and afraid to ask for help. Every day she thinks of calling the counseling 
center to make an appointment as Nathan had suggested, but then she 
talks herself out of it. She’s never been to see a counselor before and has 
no idea what it would be like or whether it could be helpful.
This chapter will follow these two students and show how a peer 
support enrichment program might be helpful in such a context. We will 
start by describing our program.
Student Support Network (SSN)
On the campus of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and with the 
support of Garrett Lee Smith funding, the Student Development & 
Counseling Center (SDCC) has developed, evolved, and implemented a 
training program intended to enhance peer support for mental health 
issues on campus. The six-­week training program, called Student Support 
Network (SSN), is a major component of WPI’s comprehensive suicide 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
208
prevention strategy. The program was designed to identify and train a 
wide range of connected and concerned students in how to recognize 
and best support other students in distress. Additionally, these students 
learn when and how to connect their peers with professional help for 
mental health concerns. Once trained, these students become part of 
WPI’s SSN, a group of students dedicated to, and supported in, reaching 
out and helping other students in distress.
The program is designed with the understanding that there are nat-
urally existing and evolving networks of student support, formal and 
informal, on any given college campus. Effectively identifying, recruiting, 
training, and supporting students from these existing peer networks can 
enhance the overall supportive and responsive atmosphere within a 
campus community. Embedded within these networks of support are 
“key” students on campus such as captains of athletic teams, fraternity 
and sorority presidents, leaders in student government and student clubs 
and organizations. Less formally, supportive networks form around stu-
dents who are perceived by their peers as “natural helpers” within exist-
ing social, living, and academic networks. While recruiting student 
leaders is an important element of the training program, any student who 
wishes to be part of SSN is welcome to apply. Ultimately, SSN is about 
forming and enhancing connections between professional helping 
resources and a wide range of students within the campus community.
Program Development and 
Implementation
SSN incorporates elements of several different evidence-­based approaches 
to suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Foundationally, SSN 
is a gatekeeper training for students, drawing core elements from the 
Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) program (Quinnett, 1995). Additionally, 
SSN was influenced by the Campus Connect Training Program, devel-
oped at Syracuse University, in that it emphasizes skill building in 
empathic responding (Syracuse University Counseling Center, 2011). 
Perhaps unique to the SSN training program are 1) its strategic focus on 
building and sustaining connections between campus support resources 
and a significant number of student helpers within the campus 

================================================================================
Teaching Mindfulness and Acceptance to Enhance Peer Support
209
community, and 2) its heavy reliance on Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 2011) in its view of psychological flexibility 
as a core component of mental health. We will first describe SSN generi-
cally and later point out how mindfulness and acceptance, through ACT, 
have been brought to bear on the development and implementation of 
this program.
SSN recruits students into the program through nomination and 
open invitation. During recruitment phases, members of the campus 
community are asked to nominate students who are well connected on 
campus and who may be perceived by their peers as “natural helpers.” 
The SSN program is also advertised throughout the year to promote 
program recognition and invite open application for training. All inter-
ested students are welcomed into the program. There is no attempt to 
screen out candidates as the program is a gatekeeper training, not a peer 
education or peer counseling program. As student trainees are already 
connected within variously effective networks of support, SSN training 
seeks to enhance their ability to recognize and respond effectively to 
their peers’ distress within their current networks of influence and 
support.
Recruitment results in diverse groups of 15 students per training 
session. Generally, two to three groups are trained simultaneously over 
six-week training periods occurring several times during the year. The 
50-­minute daytime classes fit into students’ weekly schedules. Students 
are told they must complete the entire six-week training to be part of 
SSN and that no further commitment will be asked of them after the 
training. The existence of parallel training groups allows for both success 
in initial scheduling and the availability of make-­up sessions. This system, 
and the compelling nature of the training itself, has led to over 97% 
retention rate for students who begin the training series.
The SSN training program is co-­led by two group leaders with sepa-
rate and complementary functions. The Program Manager oversees all 
efforts at student recruitment and involvement, arrangements for all 
SSN training meetings as well as SSN related events on campus. This 
role may be carried out by someone in the CCC, but other individuals 
working within student activities and/or student life, or graduate stu-
dents, may be qualified for this function. The second group leader is 
someone with a mental health background; preferably a licensed clini-
cian working within the CCC. This individual’s primary role is to provide 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
210
leadership and expertise in each of the SSN training sessions as well as 
to provide consultative advice to SSN trainees who may be concerned 
about a friend. This role can be filled by multiple individuals from the 
CCC, allowing student trainees to be exposed to a number of different 
individual clinicians and their specialties.
Six-­Week Training Program
The SSN training series encompasses areas of key knowledge, skill, and 
perspective development. Each of the 50-­minute training meetings 
involves roughly equal amounts of information sharing, group discussion, 
and experiential exercises. Limiting the size of training groups to 15 stu-
dents enhances the formation of enduring connections both between 
group members and between trainees and trainers. The formation of 
these supportive connections, essentially networking helpers in various 
roles on campus, is central to the SSN philosophy.
Key knowledge areas include information on recognizing others with 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, non-­suicidal self injury 
(NSSI), and suicidal ideation and attempts, and an awareness of the 
campus/community supports available to students experiencing various 
kinds of distress. Students are oriented to the entire continuum of sui-
cidal behavior and the importance of being willing to ask directly about 
suicidal thinking and/or behavior. It is most helpful to highlight that 
suicidal thoughts are quite common when people are experiencing 
mental health distress, yet acting on these thoughts is quite rare. 
Individuals in distress experience significant relief from being able to 
directly express suicidal thoughts to another person without being per-
ceived as crazy. This helps to reinforce the importance of asking directly 
about thoughts of self-­harm and suicide, the thought of which is particu-
larly anxiety provoking for trainees.
All content-oriented discussions are highly interactive, attempting 
to draw accurate portrayals from students’ experiences in the topic of 
concern. Training topics as well as additional mental health topics (e.g., 
problematic eating, thought disorders, relationship distress) are more 
thoroughly outlined in a training manual that each participant receives. 
Additionally, and largely due to SSN-trained student requests, more in 

================================================================================
Teaching Mindfulness and Acceptance to Enhance Peer Support
211
depth “advanced SSN training” sessions have been organized around 
topics not included originally in the series. This has become one of many 
ways that already trained students sustain connection to the SSN 
program. Skill development in the area of empathic listening and com-
passionate responding is emphasized throughout the training series. 
Students are told that of all of the helping skills one can employ, empathy/
compassion can be seen as the most important and effective way to 
provide support in the moment. Role play sessions during trainings 
revolve around the use of supportive responding skills and challenge stu-
dents to better appreciate the importance and effectiveness of empathy. 
Additionally, students enhance their skill associated with meeting resis-
tance around helping others connect with professional help. Trainees 
discuss the various reasons why people are reticent to seek professional 
help and are taught to understand and apply a “stages of change model” 
(Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984) when encouraging others to get help. 
This helps trainees recognize an internal process of decision making that 
happens for individuals contemplating making changes and/or seeking 
help, and reinforces trainees’ understanding of the importance of sus-
taining connection and expressing ongoing concerns to friends in 
distress.
Throughout the training series students are encouraged to reach out 
to clinical staff and the program manager to let them know of concerns 
they might be having about a friend. Professional staff function in a con-
sultative role in response to student concerns. Unless a situation involves 
significant risk, trainers/clinical staff do not move to take the situation 
out of the hands of the students. Concerned students are assisted in their 
efforts to support their peers and guided toward making referrals to pro-
fessional resources where advisable. In this manner, students who are 
experiencing debilitating mental health distress are encouraged by 
friends to connect with professional counseling support far earlier than 
they may have without encouragement and support. Earlier identifica-
tion of students in distress generally allows professional counselors far 
more latitude in effective intervention and short-­term treatment.
Again, returning to Nathan and Emily and the distress they are both 
experiencing in the context of their recent breakup: A mutual friend of 
both Nathan and Emily, Sarah, has felt caught in the middle of their 
struggles and has been trying to support both of them. She is very worried 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
212
about Emily, who has been avoiding going out with friends and over the 
past week has not been to classes. Sarah has been to Emily’s room several 
times to try to talk with her, but Emily refuses to open up and won’t leave 
her room. Nathan has also seemed much more stressed of late. Sarah 
knows he too is upset about the breakup and worried about Emily, but 
Nathan has shut her out as well, preferring to go out drinking with his 
fraternity brothers every night. Fortunately, Sarah has been involved in 
SSN training. She’s often thought of Emily and Nathan during training 
sessions as she’s learned about the different ways people struggle with 
mental health issues and how people often seek to escape their problems 
by avoiding them. Sarah has also learned how to be more supportive 
during the training by listening empathically. The concept of empathy 
seems so simple during the training, but the thought of listening and sup-
porting Nathan and Emily without trying to “fix” their problems is ter-
rifying to her. She’s afraid listening empathically may even make things 
worse. Sarah decides to talk to one of the SSN instructors after class 
about the situation with her friends.
Elements of Mindfulness and 
Acceptance in SSN Training
Unique to our peer support enrichment program is the infusion of several 
ACT concepts and ideas, as well as a general stance of relating to stu-
dents in our peer support enrichment program in an accepting fashion. 
We will outline these concepts below.
Universality of Human Suffering
Many core elements of the SSN training derive from ACT (Hayes et 
al., 2011). In fact, the main topic of the first week of training involves 
discussion and exercises oriented toward understanding what constitutes 
“good mental health.” Central to this discussion is the ACT core obser-
vation about the ubiquity of human suffering. A starting point for this 
discussion is sharing the observation that we all seem to struggle at 
various times in our lives, some more than others. Many of us invest 

================================================================================
Teaching Mindfulness and Acceptance to Enhance Peer Support
213
great effort in judging our thoughts and feelings, and generally keep our 
struggles to ourselves and often from ourselves. Young adults in particu-
lar, while attempting to establish themselves as autonomous and self-­
sufficient, feel the pressure to maintain the façade that they “have it all 
together.” This potentially leads to a sense of isolation and loneliness in 
our struggles, as we are acutely aware of our own suffering while observ-
ing that “everyone else” seems to have their life together. Emphasis is 
placed on how we are all faced with challenges and emotional upheaval, 
and mental health should not be defined as an absence of distress.
Such de-­stigmatizing perspectives are embedded throughout the 
training. Consistent with the ACT model (Hayes et al., 2011), in an 
attempt to further de-­stigmatize the conversation about mental health 
issues, all use of diagnostic language and medical model conceptualiza-
tions are avoided. For instance, throughout the series there is no use of 
the phrase “mental illness” in describing the manner in which people 
struggle with mental health issues. Additionally, clinical labeling and 
diagnostic language is avoided in order to promote a better understand-
ing of the universality of human suffering. Clinical labels can be stigma-
tizing in and of themselves, reinforcing an “us vs. them” mentality and 
driving individual and societal acceptance of mental health struggles 
into dark corners of embarrassment and shame. Trainers open up the 
discussion about mental health distress from a contextual perspective; 
relying more on descriptive language of how different people react to 
elevated levels of stress and various ways, effective and ineffective, people 
tend to attempt to cope.
Experiential Avoidance
A logical (but not so effective) strategy when struggling is to try to 
avoid or eliminate the things that cause us discomfort, such as uncom-
fortable feelings, scary thoughts, and disturbing memories. Through 
various means we may try to control our thoughts and avoid our feelings, 
but all too often these attempts to “cope” fall far short of success. In fact, 
attempts to avoid experience often cause additional problems. Students 
come to understand that many behavioral issues are related to individual 
attempts to escape emotional upheaval (Hayes et al., 2011): drinking or 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
214
self-­harm as a means of avoiding pain, social withdrawal and avoidance 
to manage anxiety, eating disorders as an attempt to control the internal 
experience of “helplessness,” suicidal ideation as a means to escape acute 
stress. Students are oriented to the entire continuum of suicidal behavior 
and the importance of being willing to ask directly about suicidal think-
ing and/or behavior, even when feeling uncomfortable. They also discuss 
the significance of accepting one’s own experience (e.g., discomfort or 
feeling helpless when asking a fellow student about suicide), which helps 
them appreciate the importance of both empathy and compassion as sup-
portive responses.
Self as Context/History Is Only Additive
A unique, ACT-­inspired metaphor is demonstrated to reinforce 
understanding of this conceptualization. The “Backpack” metaphor 
starts with the group leader borrowing a backpack from a student trainee 
and pointing out that the backpack, like all of the backpacks sitting in 
the room, is typically filled with a variety of “stuff.” Some of it is helpful, 
some not so helpful, some old, some newer, some stuff we love to get rid 
of, and other stuff we want to carry forever. Ultimately though, the chal-
lenge in life is figuring out how to best carry the backpack with all its 
“stuff.” History is only additive, so we can only add to the backpack but 
cannot use a delete button to undo some of its less desirable contents 
(e.g., sadness). The backpack is then held out to the side and out of view 
of the presenter. Participants are asked, “How is this for a solution?” 
Participants recognize that this (avoidance) is unworkable. Other sugges-
tions are elicited from the group (give it to someone else, wear it on your 
back, leave it behind, sort through it and lighten the load), with the 
presenter playing out and commenting on the relative effectiveness or 
limitations of each approach. Several themes emerge in the discussion, 
most importantly that avoidance strategies, though effective in the short 
term, can cause problems when over-­utilized over a longer period of time. 
Acceptance of all our “stuff” frees us up to move ahead most effectively 
toward the things most important in our lives. Students eventually see 
that wearing the backpack on their front, close to their heart, where they 
have easy access to all their stuff, may be the desired solution.

Mindfulness and Experiential Exercises
Experiential exercises are also employed to further re-­enforce the 
importance and challenges involved in acceptance. At various points 
during the training series students engage in mindfulness and/or ACT 
defusion exercises that enhance and reinforce training goals. Depending 
on time, a brief centering exercise, a 3-minute breathing space (Segal, 
Williams, and Teasdale, 2002), or a longer “body scan” exercise (Kabat-­
Zinn, 1996) is used in the first training to help students experience ele-
ments of mindfulness and acceptance. Brief processing of these exercises 
further reinforces students’ understanding of assuming a defused position 
relative to one’s experience (see chapter 3 for a more detailed explanation 
of fusion/defusion). For instance, students will often express that they 
“can’t do” or “don’t like” these exercises or conversely that they “enjoy 
meditating.” Instructors simply reflect that it’s quite common that our 
minds will want to judge or criticize the exercises, and that we can gently 
and simply try to return to the exercise each time we’re distracted.
Perspective Taking or Empathy Training
Empathy training is a central element of the SSN training series. In 
the second training session, empathy is presented to trainees as a most 
important element of overall supportive responding to others’ distress. In 
ACT, the ability of the helpers, whether an experienced therapist or a 
college student peer, to put themselves in the place of the person they are 
attempting to help is essential. Therapists being trained in ACT are 
encouraged to work on their own experiences of pain and struggle in 
order to achieve this level of empathy and compassion (Hayes et al., 
2011). In a similar vein, in our training, an empathy visualization exer-
cise (Appendix 10A, p. 29, at newharbinger.com/22225) asks trainees to 
recall a recent personal experience involving emotional distress. Students 
are directed to ask themselves, “What do I want most in this moment?” 
as they visualize their distress. Invariably, the majority of students in the 
training group agree that they want to be understood, perhaps hugged, 
and most importantly listened to. This experiential exercise is referenced 
often during the training as students inevitably begin to question the 
efficacy of empathic responding.

================================================================================

Follow Your Experience, Not What 
Your Mind Says
While most students agree that empathic responding is important; 
actually responding empathically elicits a fair bit of resistance from stu-
dents. This becomes evident in role playing sessions which are an inte-
gral part of each lesson in the training series. Early in the development of 
SSN training we found students resisted empathic responding during 
exercises, citing reasons such as “It’s making it worse,” “I’m only mimick-
ing them,” “We’re going around in circles,” and “It’s just plain not 
helpful!” Trainers would often get mired in debates about the importance 
of empathic responding. As the training series evolved we learned to 
back off the debate and, as often done in ACT (Hayes et al., 2011), point 
student trainees more to their experience: “Don’t believe a word we say, 
try out empathic responding and see what your experience tells you.” 
Student trainees are given the assignment between training sessions to 
try to genuinely employ empathy when talking to friends and/or family 
members and observe how it affects the conversation. This practice 
experience has been transformative for many trainees who report, often 
with surprise, great success in supporting others with empathic 
responding.
Defusion
We found it helpful to trigger student trainee resistance early on in 
the training by constructing role plays with an “all empathy” condition. 
We then work at building awareness around trainees’ resistance by 
employing cognitive defusion strategies (Hayes et al., 2011; see also 
chapter 3). For instance, we often respond, “Ah, so your mind is telling 
you responding this way is making them feel worse. Let’s see what 
happens when we continue empathic responding even while our mind is 
criticizing it.” Students discuss the various thoughts they experience 
during role plays, many of them negative or critical of the experience. 
Each time we just note the thought (“Thank you for sharing that 
thought”) and ask that they continue with the exercise.

================================================================================
Teaching Mindfulness and Acceptance to Enhance Peer Support
217
Integrating Various ACT Processes
Consistently, we encourage trainees to notice a strong urge to want 
to “fix the problem” when they are practicing empathic responding. It is 
our observation that attempts to fix the problem come from our own 
sense of wanting relief, as empathic responding can trigger significant 
personal discomfort. In order to maintain an empathic stance, we must 
anticipate and make room for some degree of discomfort: pain, anger, 
uncertainty, and helplessness to name a few. Repeated direct exposure of 
this discomfort and associated acceptance through defusion and mind-
fulness practices are essential to enhancing actual student empathy. It is 
only from this place of human vulnerability that we can truly provide 
another with empathy and compassion.
Going back to our situation in the beginning of the chapter, Sarah 
stayed after class after her final SSN training in order to talk with the 
instructor about her friends Emily and Nathan. She felt quite nervous 
about doing so, but was bolstered by the fact that she had gotten to know, 
respect, and trust the instructor, a counselor in the CCC. Instructors 
had also talked repeatedly in the series about “consulting” when one had 
concerns about friends; that one shouldn’t feel that one had to be alone 
in this process of helping other students. As Sarah talked about her con-
cerns regarding her friends, she noticed how the counselor was so 
empathic to her situation; he understood how she felt stuck in between 
her two friends and how worried she was. The counselor eventually sug-
gested that she try to get her friend Emily to go to the CCC by offering 
to go with her for a consultation. Additionally he suggested that she find 
a time when Nathan was sober to gently express that she misses seeing 
him and feels worried about his drinking so often.
Sarah, feeling very nervous, did talk to Emily about going to the 
CCC with her. She was able to share what she had learned about 
counseling—­that it was free and completely confidential (her parents 
wouldn’t find out), and she was also able to share that she had met several 
of the staff at the CCC during her SSN training and they seemed very 
“nice.” Emily, feeling very anxious and depressed after missing over a 
week of classes, agreed to go with her. Her cutting had recently become 
more severe, and over the past few days she had been experiencing sui-
cidal thoughts. Emily did go to counseling and experienced great relief 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
218
after her first session. She was very relieved that the counselor didn’t 
“freak out” when she talked about her cutting or her suicidal thoughts, 
and she left the office with a plan to get back on track with her classes 
and follow up in counseling. Emily knows she has some work ahead, 
learning more effective coping skills and perhaps how to deal more effec-
tively with her family, but she feels encouraged that she has professional 
support and a great friend in Sarah. Nathan was initially angry at Sarah 
when she said she thought he was drinking too much. Sarah felt disap-
pointed that she was not able to get through to him, but she remembered 
the part of the SSN training where they had talked about the process of 
change, and not to be surprised if others react defensively to expressions 
of concern. A few days later Nathan contacted Sarah to see if she wanted 
to get together and play pool. When they met, Nathan said that Emily 
told him she was going to counseling and that he was greatly relieved in 
hearing this. He went on to talk about how stressed he’d been recently, 
at first about Emily’s problems, then about his own concerns about drink-
ing. Somehow he felt he could really open up to Sarah; she was such a 
great listener.
This scenario describes a situation where a student who underwent 
SSN training based on mindfulness and acceptance triggered a chain 
reaction that was helpful to at least two people, probably many more, and 
the campus community in general. Although not all cases will proceed 
so well, this example is not rare in our experience.
Empirical Considerations
Student trainee feedback about the training series has been excellent, 
with 98% of students saying they would recommend the training to other 
students on campus. SSN-trained students have successfully made 
numerous referrals of friends into the CCC, many of whom were experi-
encing suicidal ideation. While it is not possible to ascertain whether the 
training has actually saved student lives, clearly the training has resulted 
in more open discussion about mental health issues on campus and 
expressions of concern about members of the community. The number of 
student consults with CCC staff has tripled in the past three years; 
although this cannot be attributed to the SSN specifically with certainty, 
it is likely that the SSN contributed to it.

================================================================================
Teaching Mindfulness and Acceptance to Enhance Peer Support
219
In five years of training at WPI, close to 400 students like Sarah, in 
groups of 15, have completed the series and are now part of the WPI 
SSN. The training has been very well received by students on campus; 
they genuinely enjoy the opportunity to speak openly about topics that 
are often considered taboo: self-­harm, alcohol abuse, depression, and 
suicide. Students also comment about how interesting and challenging 
the role playing aspects of the training are. Consistently, many students 
who complete the training express an interest in staying involved and 
join mental health–oriented peer groups on campus such as Active 
Minds, peer education, and existing sexual assault prevention peer 
groups.
Pre-­/post-­training measures demonstrate consistent improvement in 
student trainee confidence, skills, and knowledge of how and when to 
intervene supportively with friends. Students’ crisis-responding skills also 
show statistically significant improvement cumulatively and in all 15 
cohorts of the training completed in the first three years of the program. 
Beginning in 2009, pre-­/post-­ measures using the Acceptance & Action 
Questionnaire, AAQ-­II (Bond et al., 2011) were implemented to measure 
the impact of the training on psychological flexibility. Early results indi-
cate that students whose pre-­training scores were in the lower half of the 
respondent pool (more experiential avoidance or lower psychological 
flexibility) demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the 
post-­training measure. Students in the upper half of the AAQ-­II pool 
remained about the same on pre-­/post-­ AAQ-­II measure, although this 
may have been due to a ceiling effect, as there was not much room to 
show increases in psychological flexibility. This provides some assurance 
that the embedded ACT-­oriented discussions, metaphors, and exercises 
do lead to increased psychological flexibility among those students with 
relatively higher experiential avoidance before the training begins.
The SSN training series has also proved an excellent vehicle to 
establish contact with groups who are typically under-­served in terms of 
reaching out for mental health support. Thus far the training series has 
been specifically delivered to groups of international students and under-­
represented student groups, both of which were quite successful and 
helped foster closer contact within these groups. SSN training has also 
been quite popular with “hard to reach” groups such as student athletes 
and students within the campus Greek system. SSN training would be 
very well suited to making contact with other high risk, help resistant

groups such as returning veterans and graduate students. Our SSN 
Program described here was listed in the Suicide Prevention Resource 
Center’s “Best Practices Registry” in 2010. As noted above, a program 
manual that includes detailed information on all aspects of the training 
series, including all lesson plans, is freely available as Appendix 10A at 
www.newharbinger.com/22225. Over 150 manuals have been requested 
and distributed to college campuses that have expressed an interest in 
learning more about the program. In the past few years, several other 
campuses are at various stages of implementing the SSN training 
program, which may help with further empirical testing of this model of 
enhancing peer support on campus.
Final Words
The prevalence of student mental health distress on college campuses is 
overwhelming, particularly for students who are often most acutely aware 
of their peers’ struggles. Fortunately, college campuses offer connected 
and supportive communities with easily accessible mental health 
resources. Campuses can experience great benefit by adopting a preven-
tive health approach to enhancing the level of understanding, compas-
sion, support, and referral of those in the community who are experienc-
ing significant distress, particularly students whose distress extends to 
suicidal ideation. This may require a somewhat challenging shift of per-
spective on college campuses, CCCs in particular, to allocate time and 
resources to strategic preventive models such as the SSN training 
program described here. Investing more time in preventive models also 
needs to be accompanied by adequately staffed counseling resources, to 
respond to critical referrals from the campus community. Upper level 
administrative support for initiatives such as this can be achieved by 
emphasizing that investing time and energy in community trainings ori-
ented toward recognizing and responding to student distress enhances 
overall safety within the communities. Most students are uniquely situ-
ated and highly motivated to support their friends in distress, but often 
these young adults lack the confidence and skills to do so. Investing time 
and energy in connecting, training, and supporting students in their 
natural roles as helpers can make campus communities more supportive 
and responsive to the needs of those who may be struggling.

Conceptualizations and philosophical underpinnings inherent in 
ACT offer an excellent foundation from which to design and implement 
strategic preventive programming on college campuses to enhance the 
safety and well-­being of students. Students enjoy and benefit from ACT’s 
use of various and engaging modalities, such as metaphor and experien-
tial exercises, in better understanding how to open up to and effectively 
support their peers’ distress. Student trainees have eagerly embraced the 
concept that demonstrating openness and acceptance to friends in dis-
tress is foundational to their ability to provide support when their friends 
are struggling. More globally, widespread introduction and development 
of acceptance, mindfulness, and empathy on campus, particularly with 
students, can catalyze overall openness and support and make for health-
ier and safer communities.

F
or several years, the first author was a guest speaker in classes to 
discuss “stress and coping” with college freshmen, usually around 
midterms. Over time, she developed an approach she called “Dear 
Jacque” (a la “Dear Abby” the advice columnist) to these presentations. 
All students would write an anonymous question on a piece of paper 
about a situation they were struggling with, from a stress and coping 
perspective. These two excerpts are paraphrases of some of these anony-
mous questions. “Dear Jacque” would then skim through these notes and 
pick 3-­4 distinct questions to discuss with the rest of the class. Oftentimes, 
several different students would think that the question being read was 
“his” question. This experience alone illustrated a useful point to 
students—­the ubiquity of suffering.
The first quote above is from a class with students coming from rural 
settings, and the second from a first year seminar for athletes. Both of 
these students, although struggling, are unlikely to walk into the college 
counseling center (CCC), perhaps because they don’t feel like their con-
cerns are severe enough, they are afraid of being stigmatized, or a range 
of other reasons (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009). The 
college athlete quoted above actually laughed when counseling was rec-
ommended, “I’m just homesick, dude.” These two students are not alone. 
According to a recent survey of CCC directors, although CCCs see 
approximately 10% of the student body in individual or group therapy in 
a given year, only approximately 20% of college students who killed 
themselves in recent years had ever been seen at the local CCC (Gallagher, 
2011).
Most young adults successfully negotiate developmental challenges 
in college—­in a recent survey, 59% of college students showed no formal 
psychological distress and 20% were thriving while in college (Whitlock, 
in preparation). However, for others, the two vignettes above may mark 
the beginning of a downward trend that can result in dropping out of 
college or developing chronic mental health problems (Kadison & 
DiGeronimo, 2004). New approaches are needed to reach a large swath 
of the student population, some of whom would be unlikely to come into 
a CCC on their own.
College classrooms provide such an opportunity. Classes are not psy-
chotherapy groups, however, and students vary widely in their degree of 
distress. Fortunately, the psychological flexibility models provide 
common core targets that can both ameliorate distress and promote

learning (e.g., Varra, Hayes, Roget, & Fisher, 2008), reduce stigmatiza-
tion of others (Masuda et al., 2007), and prevent the development of 
psychological problems (Muto, Hayes, & Jeffcoat, 2011).
This chapter will describe four instances of attempting to teach 
college students mindfulness and acceptance skills in classroom settings. 
The four projects described in this chapter relied on Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, and Wilson, 2011) as 
their foundation. These projects either created ACT classes or infused 
ACT into existing types of psychology classes. In two instances, ACT 
classes were offered to students (one exclusively for freshmen and the 
other across all class standings) in order to prevent the development or 
exacerbation of mental health problems. In the two other instances, 
ACT was infused into existing course content for a psychology of racial 
differences or an abnormal psychology class, with the deliberate intent to 
reduce stigma about mental health problems among students. At the end 
of the chapter, issues having to do with bringing mindfulness and accep-
tance into a classroom format in general will be discussed.
Project 1: Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) 
as a First Year Seminar (FYS)4

Most universities offer some type of First Year Seminar (FYS) to fresh-
men students (Padgett & Keup, 2011). The purpose of these classes is to 
teach various aspects of college life in order to help freshman college 
students adjust more effectively to college.

J. Pistorello; Co-Is: J. Seeley and T. Biglan) from the National Institute of Mental Health

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings

There are many different types of FYSs, some of which date back to 
the early 1900s (Padgett & Keup, 2011), but a popular form of FYS is that 
of an “extended orientation” consisting of “an introduction to campus 
resources, time management, academic and career planning, learning 
strategies, and an introduction to student development issues” (Padgett 
& Keup, 2011, p. 2). Participation in FYS is associated with positive out-
comes, such as persistence into the second year in college, improved aca-
demic performance, and positive changes in other related experiences 
associated with retention in college (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). FYSs 
seem well suited to deliver interventions designed to both prevent and 
ameliorate mental health problems among college students.
The purpose of this project was to design and test the acceptability 
and perceived usefulness of an FYS that taught skills to deal with psycho-
logical challenges through an ACT class composed of eight two-­hour ses-
sions. This 1-­credit class covered all processes articulated in ACT (Hayes 
et al., 2011; see chapter 3), relying on a PowerPoint presentation in order 
to enhance fidelity to the research protocol by different instructors (class 
presentations and a manual for instructors and are available as Appendix 
11A at www.newharbinger.com/22225). All instructors were trainees, 
either graduate students or postdoctoral fellows, trained in ACT previ-
ously. The credit for the class and the textbook, Get Out of Your Mind and 
Into Your Life (Hayes & Smith, 2005), were paid for by grant funds. The 
class was structured by covering 1-­2 ACT processes each week, which 
roughly coincided with the workbook chapters (Hayes & Smith, 2005). 
Chapters 3 and 4 of this book contain a thorough description of ACT, 
thus our presentation here will be focused on our approach.
Principles in Adapting ACT to 
an FYS Format
The following are some of the principles used in the development and 
implementation of the ACT-­based FYS. In ACT, principles take prece-
dence over actual content (Hayes et al., 2011). Therefore, emphasis was 
placed on articulating key principles in adapting ACT to a non-clinical 
setting like a college classroom.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students

Speak to All Levels of Life Experience, 
Without Assuming Fragility
Class presentations had to resonate to a wide range of life experi-
ences. For example, creative hopelessness as it is traditionally done 
(Hayes et al., 2011) might resonate with a freshman student struggling 
with anxiety or depression but might alienate students who are function-
ing well or dealing only with normal developmental issues, as in the first 
vignette above. We adjusted to this challenge by including examples 
across a wide range of life experiences. For example, when discussing the 
difference between pain and suffering, examples were drawn from 
common situations such as how avoidance of prompt payment of a 
parking ticket leads to a surcharge, as well as clinically serious ones such 
as how avoidance of trauma memories may lead to substance abuse 
(Follette & Pistorello, 2007). Some ACT techniques were bypassed in 
favor of those that were more generally applicable, but we did not treat 
students as if they were fragile, and material was included that had high 
emotional content.
The Process within the Class Is Just 
as Important as the Content
Consistency in content was important given the research nature of 
the project, but delivery itself occurred from an ACT stance (Hayes et 
al., 2011). For example, instructors participated in most exercises, and 
modeled vulnerability and taking responsible risks.
For example, in Class 8, the students and teacher reflected upon the 
“Label Parade” defusion exercise in which students and teacher wrote 
judgments about themselves they were ready to let go of on name badges 
they wore (see Appendix 11A for details), in a way that focused on fusion 
as a common human problem:
ACT	
You know, they’re just words on paper. They won’t hurt  
Instructor:	
you. And, what about mine? It says, “I’m an imposter.”
Student:	
I’m curious as to why you put that.

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
229
ACT	
Well, I think it’s actually a thought that a lot of us  
Instructor: 	 teachers have. Every time they have me teach a class, I 
think, “Are they crazy? Why are they asking me to teach 
this?” “I’m an imposter” shows up every time. We could 
sit here and think of all the ways that is not true, but I 
know from experience that my mind will come up with 
just as many reasons as to why it could be true. Check 
and see in your own experience too… It could turn into 
a never ending discussion where my mind tries to render 
a verdict on whether I am or am not “an imposter.” The 
more important question is this: can we accept having 
these sticky thoughts, which we can’t get rid of anyhow, 
and move in the direction that matters to us? That’s 
what I’m doing when I teach this class every week.”
This is one of many opportunities for the instructor to illustrate the 
commonality of the human experience and model acceptance of, and 
defusion from, difficult thoughts and feelings.
Orienting and Re-orienting Students 
to the Interventions Is Necessary
The relevance of material was sustained by linking methods to their 
purpose. This included:
1.	 Noting relevance to students’ lives –­ now and in the future. 
A challenge in prevention is to make content relevant not just to 
the current situation but to experiences not yet contacted. ACT 
instructors attempted to do so by linking methods to experi-
ences they may be witnessing in others (e.g., a roommate who’s 
depressed) or to experiences they may have in the future (e.g., 
relationships may end), or by highlighting possible examples 
from a range of current situations that show the core processes 
involved (e.g., “Have you guys ever had the experience of all of a 
sudden feeling hungry, in need of a nap, or a strong desire to 
check e-­mail right when you were supposed to start studying?”).

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students

2.	 Preparing students ahead of time for the different strategies 
used in ACT and why that matters (e.g., language is the 
problem so we need to rely on metaphors instead). Within a 
classroom format, clear rationale needs to be used to ensure that 
ACT interventions make sense to students. For example, when 
introducing ACT, the instructor might say, “Sometimes our 
minds are so apt to come up with the same old way of doing 
things that we need to create a space where we wipe the slate 
clean, where confusion is allowed to occur and stay for a while, 
so that we can truly do something new. There is a Zen teaching 
device called a koan, a question that has no logical answer, that 
may allow one to look at things with ‘beginner’s eyes’ (Kabat-­
Zinn, 2005). An example of a koan might be ‘What is the sound 
of one hand clapping?’ If you feel confused here on occasion, see 
if you can make room for that and still remain engaged.”
3.	 Providing purpose and choice for an unusual exercise. With 
“Eyes On” (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), where students sit 
across from each other and maintain eye contact in silence with 
their knees touching, we initially had some concern about the 
students’ ability to tolerate this exercise. However, following our 
first principle of not treating students as fragile, we conducted 
this exercise as it is normally done. Nobody complained about 
the exercise later in evaluations, and several cited it as one of the 
exercises that had the most impact. To ensure a positive outcome 
we provided a strong rationale for the exercise: “This is about 
noticing and riding the waves of discomfort.” We also empha-
sized that each student had a choice about whether or not he 
wanted to participate. Everyone did, but it seems important to 
maintain choice when entering into potentially uncomfortable 
and evocative experiences.
Accepting that Students Will Progress at 
Their Own Pace
Although in ACT as psychotherapy, control-­based strategies are 
usually vigorously undermined, a more open approach is necessary in 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
231
classes with students who may or may not be in distress. If a student 
appeared to be overly confused or in disagreement, teachers were 
instructed to fall back on “Let this percolate, see if it doesn’t show up in 
some areas of your life this week.”
Similarly, the ACT instructors were coached on how to respond in 
an ACT-consistent manner to overt efforts to avoid. Sample responses in 
these situations could be the following:
• Invite the student to bring the internal barrier along: “Would 
you be willing to try it anyhow and bring the thought ‘This won’t 
work’ along?”
• Highlight the commonality of the experience: “How many 
people in this room have had a thought like that at least once in 
their life (or today)?”
• Encourage increased mindfulness, as opposed to changing 
behavior, by asking the student just to notice, in the coming 
week, how often her mind says this or that.
• Explore barriers: “What got in the way of your doing the 
homework?”
• Thank the student: “Thank you for bringing this up today.”
• Move to process: “What was it like to share this with the whole 
class?”
Instructors Must Be Watchful of Their 
Own Anti-­ACT Behaviors
There is a certain challenge maintaining an active and experiential 
approach while “teaching” a class on ACT to college students. Instructors 
were asked:
• If you find yourself talking too much or working hard to con-
vince students, do something else (e.g., ask the class questions, 
have them read and reflect from a small section in the book, or 
split students into dyads to discuss an experience or idea).

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
232
• Try not to predict students’ experience. When in doubt, ask 
them and use that in class.
• Focus on the current experience rather than “talking about” an 
experience.
• Look at everything as “grist for the mill.” See if you can find a 
way to turn a “failed” experiment by a student into a teaching 
moment for the whole class: “That’s a great example. How can 
we get back on track when we try really hard and it doesn’t 
work?”
The More Relevant and Engaging to 
College Students, the Better
To increase engagement, instructors incorporated into the class ani-
mations, YouTube videos, movies, books, commercials, recent events, 
etc. For example, rather than using a generic question when President 
Obama was scheduled to be on campus, the instructor asked, “How 
would we set up a banquet for President Obama?” to demonstrate the 
power of our minds to problem solve.
“Emerging adulthood” (18-­25 years of age) is a unique period marked 
by identity explorations, instability, renewed self-­focus, and feeling “in 
between” (Arnett, 2000). The sensitivity of college students to the tran-
sition from childhood to adulthood was leveraged for a variety of pur-
poses. For example, during a class targeting self-­compassion, we showed 
a YouTube video that portrayed adults engaging in behaviors such as 
name calling or hitting someone, in front of children—who then imi-
tated the same behavior. The instructor utilized this video to set up a 
discussion about compassion and self-compassion vis-à-vis our unique 
histories (see Appendix 11B for a detailed description of this exercise). 
Instructors were encouraged to be creative and try to reach these “emerg-
ing adults” in multiple ways.

Flexibility and Freedom for 
Instructors Is Essential
It is important for instructors to have some flexibility and freedom in 
the delivery of the content. To foster this, some of the material for the 
lecture was considered essential while other aspects were optional, 
leaving it up to the instructor to pick among several metaphors and exer-
cises listed for that particular class. Instructors could bring in their own 
material, or improvise on an exercise. To elaborate on certain concepts, 
students themselves were encouraged to bring in their own materials 
(e.g., songs, poems) and initiate and shape discussions through their own 
experiences.
Empirical Considerations: 
Acceptability and Perceived 
Usefulness of an ACT FYS
This FYS class was compared to a well-­crafted control condition consist-
ing of a more didactic presentation of materials pertaining to adjustment 
to college: time management, making career choices, learning about 
resources on campus, and learning about depression, anxiety, substance 
abuse, and relationship problems among college students. Students in the 
more standard class had a book that consisted of handpicked chapters 
from an available FYS textbook. This book had a great deal of face valid-
ity for college freshmen. A total of 732 college freshmen, recruited across 
three academic years, were randomized. Approximately 38% of partici-
pants were male, 33% were ethnic or racial minorities, and 25% were 
diagnosable with a current mental health problem. The mean age was 18 
(SD=.4). Data regarding the impact on mental health problems is not yet 
available, but below we provide a brief description of issues of acceptabil-
ity and perceived usefulness of the class. Details of this study are reported 
elsewhere (Pistorello et al., 2012).

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
234
Satisfaction with Classes
Given its experiential nature, it is important to see if ACT, packaged 
as an FYS, is acceptable to college freshmen. At posttest, a standardized 
class evaluation instrument was used, with items such as “Course materi-
als are well prepared and carefully explained,” “You have learned and 
understood subject materials in this course,” and “Instructor is enthusi-
astic about teaching the course.” Ratings could range from 1-­5, and 
classes from both conditions received high marks (almost all in the 4-­5 
range on average) indicating high satisfaction. There were no differences 
across conditions, suggesting that the ACT class showed an equally high 
degree of acceptability among college freshmen, as compared to a typical 
FYS specifically designed for college freshmen.
Perceived Usefulness of the Class
Students were asked to predict at posttest how useful the class will be 
for them in the next year. Ratings on the usefulness of the class immedi-
ately post-­class were just below 4 (on a 1-­5 scale, with higher scores indi-
cating higher predicted usefulness) and did not differ by condition. 
However, when students from the first cohort (n = 235) came back one 
year later, those in the ACT class were significantly more likely to report 
the class as having been useful the year before than students in the 
control condition.
Project 2: One-­Day ACT Well-­Being 
Training for College Students
Vasiliki Christodoulou
The second project we will describe was conducted in the United 
Kingdom (UK) and was focused on the promotion of well-­being. The 
need for such initiatives is emphasized by UK statistics showing an 
upward increase in student suicide rates from 2007 to 2011 (Office for 
National Statistics, 2012) as well as by surveys indicating a high 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
235
prevalence of clinical distress in the UK student body (e.g., Bewick, Gill, 
Mulhern, Barkham & Hill, 2008). There is the hope that prevention 
initiatives could benefit students’ psychological well-­being, improve edu-
cational performance, and promote social inclusion and community rela-
tions (Universities UK/ Guild Higher Education Committee for the 
Promotion of Mental Well-­Being, 2007).
The program delivered a five-­hour (one-­day) Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 2011) well-­being training to 
volunteering university students. The training was delivered as a work-
shop at a university campus in groups of six to ten students. It was offered 
in the context of two randomized controlled trials evaluating the effec-
tiveness of an ACT well-­being training compared to a waitlist control.
Overview of ACT Well-­Being 
Training
The protocol was adapted from an ACT well-­being program previously 
delivered in the worksite (Flaxman & Bond, 2006). It was designed as a 
hands-­on, generic ACT intervention providing elements of the model’s 
central processes (see chapter 3). The primary aims of the intervention 
were to illustrate the unworkable nature of experiential avoidance and 
introduce mindfulness as an alternative, and to activate personal values 
as an effective guide to action. The trainer organized the day by making 
a tentative distinction between people’s internal world (e.g., thoughts, 
feelings, and physical sensations) and people’s external world (e.g., behav-
ior). This distinction was illustrated on a flipchart by drawing a human 
figure and identifying examples of “internal world” (e.g., stress, relax-
ation) and “external world” experiences (e.g., procrastination, physical 
exercise). Mindfulness was presented as an effective way of handling 
internal experiences and values choice as a skill associated with greater 
life satisfaction and effective behavior. The trainer referred back to this 
diagram while introducing different exercises or metaphors (see also 
chapters 3 and 4). See Appendix 11C for an organizing diagram for the 
day-long training.
Students reflected on “what effectiveness means to them” and how it 
relates to personally meaningful actions. They identified barriers to 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
236
effective living (e.g., fear, worry, anger) and strategies they previously 
used to get rid of these difficulties (e.g., avoidance, distraction, alcohol 
use). The effectiveness of these strategies in the short and long term was 
explored. After students experimented with a suppression exercise 
(trying not to think of an item), mindfulness was introduced as a way of 
noticing challenging internal experiences without having to change or 
remove them. Throughout the day participants tried a selection of mind-
fulness practices (e.g., physicalizing of thoughts and feelings; Hayes et al., 
2011).
Students were encouraged to identify personally meaningful life 
directions and formulate associated goals and actions in written exercises 
(Bond, 2004, pp. 288-­290). The trainer used the flipchart to draw a 
“Passengers on the Bus” metaphor highlighting how attempts to control 
internal experiences can side-­track us from valued living (Hayes et al., 
2011; see also chapter 7). To develop defusion skills, students partnered 
up to “take their minds for a walk” around the campus (Hayes et al., 
2011, p. 259; 2011, p. 359; see Appendix 11D for questions to debrief this 
exercise effectively). Students often conclude that it is possible to move 
toward valued directions while having “busy” minds. The “observing 
self” was introduced through the “chessboard” metaphor using a real 
chessboard and pieces (Hayes et al., 2011). Finally, students were encour-
aged to practice mindfulness daily for a month using an audio CD con-
taining a selection of short and long practices and behavioral homework 
where they could record value-­consistent actions (see Appendix 11E for 
a form for students to record their values-based actions).
Empirical Considerations: 
Effectiveness of a One-­Day ACT 
Well-­Being Training
The training was evaluated in two randomized controlled trials compar-
ing it to a waitlist control group, reported elsewhere in greater detail 
(Christodoulou & Flaxman, 2012). Questionnaire data were collected 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
237
from both groups on various mental health outcomes and on hypothe-
sized ACT process variables over a period of three months (at baseline, 
at one month, and at two months). After completing the final question-
naires, participants provided written feedback on the intervention.
In both studies participants were university students drawn from 
numerous courses. Approximately one third of students who originally 
expressed an interest in the training did not sign up for it later, for various 
reasons (e.g., schedule conflict). No participant dropped out during the 
training day although five students (across two studies) signed-­up for the 
training and failed to attend.
In the first trial (n = 65, 70.5% female), at one month ACT showed 
improved stress, anxiety, and depression outcomes with medium effect 
sizes, but outcomes were not maintained at two-­months. In the second 
trial (n = 71, 69% female), comparisons at two-­months, but not at one-­
month, revealed significant differences benefiting the ACT group on 
stress, anxiety and psychological well-­being with medium to large effect 
sizes. The two trials occurred during different parts of the academic year, 
which may help explain these differences. Across the two studies, ACT 
training showed significant differences when assessments were con-
ducted during exam periods (at one-­month in Study 1 and at two-­months 
in Study 2), but not during holidays.
Results showed that ACT processes (see chapter 3) accounted for 
most improved outcomes in the ACT groups. Mediation analyses showed 
that reduced believability in “sticky” thoughts partially mediated the 
between-­group differences at one-­month for stress and anxiety in the 
first study. In the second study reductions in stress and improvements in 
psychological well-­being at two-­months were partially and fully (respec-
tively) mediated by increases in mindfulness and psychological flexibility 
for the ACT group.
Qualitative feedback showed that about 38% of participants reported 
pursuing the skills in a systematic or sporadic way, whereas a similar per-
centage reported experimenting with the skills initially or not at all. 
About a quarter lost their enthusiasm a few weeks after the training. 
Informal mindfulness practices were used more frequently than formal 
mindfulness practices. Practicing had “low priority” when other con-
cerns were dominant (i.e., coursework, tiredness, ill health, and spending 
time with family) and fluctuated with participants’ emotional state.

================================================================================

Reflections on the Program
The program was advertised as “life effectiveness training” through 
flyers and e-­mail announcements, and thus participants felt comfortable 
with enrolling and quoted their motivation as “self-­development.” The 
small group size seemed to facilitate participation, while helping the 
trainer keep an emphasis on students’ experiential learning. Short, expe-
riential practices were more successful. Students related well to meta-
phors that were either acted out physically or delivered in pictorial form. 
Mindfulness practices were also kept short (10 minutes maximum), as 
pilot sessions indicated that longer practices felt tiresome and students 
lost their interest.
Probably due to an informal, psychoeducational format, the program 
attracted students from a wide array of backgrounds, from different 
departments and academic years, and with different levels of psychologi-
cal distress at entry. There was considerable interest in joining the 
program, although about 1/3 later decided not to participate, as attend-
ing for a full day was difficult given their busy schedules. The one-­day 
format had the advantage of keeping the cost of the training low, and 
eliminating program drop out, but offering flexible formats may make 
similar interventions more accessible.
Project 3: Infusing ACT into 
Undergraduate Classes in Psychology 
of Racial Differences
Jason Lillis and Steven C. Hayes
Multicultural education has become a requirement for training in many 
mental health fields, such as psychology and counseling (cf. Smith, 
Constantine, Dunn, Dinehart, & Montoya, 2006). Originally empha-
sized in graduate training, racial differences or multicultural psychology 
courses are often now taught at the undergraduate level. Undergraduate 
courses provide a venue for changing prejudicial behaviors in a large 
swath of the emerging adult population. Delivery of information alone is 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
239
not always effective in reducing prejudice (Corrigan & Penn, 1999), in 
part because it can apply social pressure to not appear prejudiced or have 
prejudiced thoughts, which can lead to thought suppression efforts. Such 
suppression efforts have consistently been shown to produce a subse-
quent increase in prejudiced thoughts as well as discriminatory behaviors 
toward the target group (e.g., Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000; Kulik, Perry, 
& Bourhis, 2000).
However, given that research suggested that an acceptance-­based 
approach might be effective in reducing stigma (Hayes et al., 2004), a 
study was conducted to infuse a 75-­minute ACT lecture into two under-
graduate courses on the psychology of racial and ethnic differences. The 
details are presented elsewhere (Lillis & Hayes, 2007); here we will 
describe some of the underlying theory and ACT interventions used to 
attempt to reduce prejudice.
ACT Content Infused into Racial 
Differences Class
From an ACT perspective, prejudice is the objectification and dehuman-
ization of people as a result of their participation in evaluative verbal 
categories (Hayes, Niccolls, Masuda, & Rye, 2002). Trying to change or 
modify prejudiced verbal content is a difficult task. ACT provides an 
alternative approach using acceptance and mindfulness processes to 
reduce the impact of prejudicial thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, and 
values and behavior change processes to promote behavior more consis-
tent with chosen ideals (Hayes et al., 2011). The first key component of 
this approach is to undermine the literal impact of prejudicial thoughts, 
without directly trying to change them in form or frequency. From an 
ACT perspective, behaving in a prejudiced and discriminatory fashion is 
unacceptable, but ironically a powerful way to reduce the behavioral 
impact of prejudicial thoughts is to accept that we all have them.
Cognitive defusion techniques were used to illustrate the automatic 
nature of thoughts through experiential exercises. For example, the 
classic ACT exercise “What are the numbers?” asks participants to 
remember a series of innocuous and arbitrary numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 
illustrating how easy it is to program thinking (Hayes et al, 2011). This 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
240
was followed by simply asking participants to complete common sayings, 
such as “There’s no place like….[home]” or “Only the good die…
[young].” This set a non-­shaming context for discussing the nature of 
programming, and the many influences we’ve been exposed to (parents, 
media, peers, internet).
The next step was to have participants observe these processes in 
relation to prejudicial stimuli. We asked participants to “notice their pro-
gramming” by completing statements in writing, such as “Most black 
people tend to…” or, “People who live in this country and don’t speak 
the language are….” It is important to create a safe space where students 
can simply be aware of and watch these verbal processes without having 
to suppress or censor what shows up, in order to promote awareness of 
the automatic nature of prejudicial thoughts. The ensuing discussion 
validated the normality of whatever thought content showed up but 
focused on our responsibility to address any overt behaviors traditionally 
evoked by being “fused” with these historical and automatic thoughts. 
Defusion exercises (e.g., word repetition) were used to provide examples 
of how to undermine their behavioral impact.
Another key component was teaching acceptance of unwanted emo-
tions. We are commonly taught that our biased reactions, such as feeling 
anxious around a group of strangers of a different racial or ethnic back-
ground, are “wrong.” From an ACT perspective, our emotional reactions 
are not directly controllable and are not themselves our enemy. Indeed, 
trying to eliminate or control emotional reactions can lead to avoidance 
behavior that violates our values. For example, despite pro-­diversity 
values, a Caucasian teenager may come to avoid his African-­American 
peers because he knows it is “wrong” to feel anxious around them. From 
an ACT perspective, the goal is to step out of the struggle with emotions 
and orient to behavior consistent with chosen values.
The intervention targeted mindful awareness of emotional experi-
ences through guided imagery. We presented a series of scenarios and 
asked participants to notice any emotional reactions or changes in their 
body. For example, one scenario involved a person of a different race or 
ethnicity getting hired for a job instead of you. The class debriefing vali-
dated the normalcy of any emotional reactions that showed up while also 
pointing out the cost of emotion avoidance to values-­based actions. 
Demanding the absence of difficult emotions can inhibit diversity 
seeking and pro-­social behavior. The latter problem was illustrated using 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
241
the “Polygraph” metaphor, a classic ACT metaphor that points out the 
impossibility of trying to force yourself to be calm while having a gun 
pointed to your head (Hayes et al., 2011).
We made an important distinction that acceptance is not about 
treating reactions as true or valid in a verbal sense. For example, if one 
feels anxious around Arabs, acceptance does not mean that it is “right” 
to act suspeciously around Arabs. Acceptance means being willing to 
experience that anxiety in the service of behaving consistently with 
chosen values, such as creating relationships.
Choosing values was another important component of the ACT 
intervention infused into these racial differences classes. We appealed 
broadly to relationship values by asking participants to imagine being at 
their 85th birthday party and having each important person in their life 
speak about them (Hayes et al., 2011). The goal is to imagine an ideal, if 
you were exactly the person you wanted to be in relation to the people 
you care about. Common themes included being a loving person, treat-
ing people with respect, being close and connected to others, being 
honest and open, learning from others, and being loyal and dependable. 
Once these core values were present, they were organized into values 
statements and broadened out to include a broader and broader range of 
people: coworkers; members of one’s town, state, country, and world; all 
human beings, including those associated with stereotypes.
The final piece of the ACT intervention was making behavioral 
commitments. Any activity designed to get participants exposed to new 
experiences and people fit here, with specific attention to being mindful, 
defused, and accepting, while orienting to behavior consistent with 
chosen values. For example, students were prompted to attend a social 
club or party in which they would be the only person of their race or 
ethnicity.
Empirical Considerations: Outcome 
Findings of ACT Infusion in Racial 
Differences Classes
This 75-­minute ACT intervention was studied using two undergraduate 
classes in psychology of racial differences (n=32), who were presented 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
242
with the ACT intervention and a multicultural education-­based inter-
vention in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that the ACT inter-
vention was more effective at increasing positive behavioral intentions to 
engage in pro-­diversity activities at post-­ and 1-­week follow-­up. These 
changes were associated with other self-­reported changes that fit the 
ACT model (for further review, see Lillis & Hayes, 2007).
Project 4: Using an Acceptance-­Based 
Model to Reduce Mental Health 
Stigma within an Abnormal 
Psychology Course
Jenna LeJeune
The undergraduate abnormal psychology course is often the first, and 
frequently only, course where college students develop their basic ideas 
about psychological suffering and mental illness. Abnormal Psychology is 
highly encouraged or even required for a wide range of degree programs 
including nursing, pre-­medicine, criminal justice, and occupational 
therapy. Previous research has shown that stigmatizing behaviors and 
beliefs toward those with psychological and behavioral disorders remain 
high even among therapists or others working with these populations 
(Maslach, Jackson, & Leiter, 1996). Therefore, those working “on the 
front lines,” such as health professionals and law enforcement officers, 
would be key groups to target in stigma-­reduction interventions.
While some have highlighted the unique opportunity of abnormal 
psychology courses as a place to target mental health stigma (Curtin, 
Martz, Bazzini, & Vicente, 2004), taking such a course may not neces-
sarily help decrease students’ stigma toward mental health problems. 
Indeed, at times traditional abnormal psychology courses may actually 
increase students’ level of mental health stigma (Kendra, Cattaneo, & 
Mohr, 2012; Sadow, Ryder, & Webster, 2002). Previous attempts to target 
mental health stigma within the classroom have generally focused on 
one of three types of interventions: 1. educational/informational inter-
ventions, 2. contact-­based education, and 3. verbal confrontation of 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings
243
negative attitudes (Corrigan & Penn, 1999). Although both educational 
and contact-­based interventions may have some positive stigma-­reduction 
results, these benefits appear to be short-­lived. Verbal confrontation (e.g., 
instructing people why it’s “bad” to stigmatize those with psychological 
problems) has generally been found to be ineffective (Corrigan et. al, 
2001, 2002). Interventions based on acceptance-­based models provide a 
new avenue toward stigma reduction (Hayes et al., 2004) that may be 
well suited for the classroom setting (Masuda et al., 2007).
ACT Content Infused into Abnormal 
Psychology Classes
For this project, we created a new curriculum informed by stigma-­ and 
prejudice-­focused interventions previously tested in other settings (e.g. 
Hayes et al., 2004; Luoma, Kohlenberg, Hayes, Bunting, & Rye, 2008; 
Masuda et. al., 2007; Masuda, Hayes, Lillis, Bunting, Herbst, & Fletcher, 
2009). The curriculum was organized around eight principles focused on 
core processes of ACT. These included helping students:
1.	 Notice the process of objectification of others and build aware-
ness of biases and the automatic process of stereotyping.
2.	 Normalize the occurrence of prejudiced thinking, so that it need 
not be suppressed or avoided and can be accepted.
3.	 Differentiate between prejudiced thoughts and prejudiced 
behavior.
4.	 Accept and defuse from prejudiced thinking.
5.	 Facilitate a hierarchical frame of a “common humanity” in suf-
fering that competes with the tendency toward “us vs. them” 
framing that is part of objectification and stigma.
6.	 Open up to difficult emotions rather than attempting to sup-
press difficult thoughts and emotions related to themselves and 
others.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
244
7.	 Develop a positive sense of connection and empathy in relation 
to the target group (i.e., those identified as “mentally ill”).
8.	 Articulate values and set intentions for how they would want to 
be toward people in the stigmatized group.
Based on these 8 principles, we developed five 30-­45 minute modules. 
The link to the complete curriculum, including outcome measures used, 
can be found in Appendix 11F.
The curriculum was revised over the course of several semesters of 
pilot testing, based on student feedback. Our goal was to create a cur-
riculum that could be imbedded into more traditional abnormal psychol-
ogy curricula so as to maximize dissemination opportunities. The class 
in which this curriculum was implemented met once per week for four 
hours, and each module was conducted during the last 45 minutes of 
class for five consecutive weeks. For a class meeting multiple times per 
week, this curriculum could be implemented as a stand-­alone section 
over five consecutive classes.
Each module was organized around a theme. Class one provided an 
introduction to the curriculum and focused on building awareness of 
social classification. Class two sought to normalize the occurrence of 
prejudice thinking and suggest acceptance as an alternative strategy. 
Class three focused on building a sense of common humanity and 
common suffering in relation to psychological suffering. Class four taught 
students to differentiate between prejudiced thoughts and prejudiced 
behavior. In addition, this module focused on helping students defuse 
from stereotype-­based thinking while developing a positive sense of con-
nection and empathy in relation to the stigmatized group. Finally, in 
class five, exercises focused on helping students set intentions for how 
they would want to behave toward people in the stigmatized group.
Each module incorporated several in-­class exercises, each targeting 
one or more of the eight principles described above. The experiential 
exercises included were adapted from previously established acceptance- 
and mindfulness-­based protocols used in other settings (e.g. training 
workshops in ACT, published ACT protocols, etc.) including commonly 
used ACT exercises such as “Milk, Milk, Milk,” the “Cross-­cutting 
Categories” exercise, and “Thoughts on Cards” (Hayes et al., 2011). After 
each of the first four modules, students were given an experiential task to 
complete outside of class that was connected to the lesson for that week 

================================================================================
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings

and asked to write brief reflection papers on the experience. Participation 
in both in-­class and out-­of-­class experiential exercises was voluntary and 
students were told that their decision to participate or not would in no 
way impact their grade. The written homework assignments were man-
datory and students who declined the experiential activity were given 
the option of an alternative written assignment.
Empirical Considerations: Perceived 
Usefulness of the ACT Infusion into 
Abnormal Psychology Classes
Preliminary analyses of feedback from the first two pilot cohorts was 
highly positive. Anonymous written feedback included “These last 5 
weeks have been extremely meaningful to me,” “The assignments didn’t 
stop when we turned in homework. The ideas lasted and stayed in my 
mind,” “I felt this was a fantastic learning tool,” and “It opened my heart 
a bit more and usually I feel I’m bad with empathy.” The majority of stu-
dents (n=36) “agreed” or “strongly agreed” with the statements “I felt 
what we did was meaningful” (81%) and “I learned something important 
that will impact my life outside of class” (83%). Feasibility was also dem-
onstrated by more than a 95% completion rate for the optional experien-
tial portions of homework assignments.
The curriculum is usable by teachers with a relatively small amount 
of training; formal research will be needed to see whether it is successful. 
These early findings suggest that the ACT model may provide a mean-
ingful and effective way to target mental health stigma among those 
enrolled in an abnormal psychology course.
Final Words
This chapter illustrated four different ways of bringing mindfulness and 
acceptance into classroom settings, either as stand-­alone interventions 
or as infused into psychology classes. The data suggest that these methods 
have high acceptability and perceived usefulness in classroom settings;

formal research on other outcomes is early but is tentatively supportive. 
These are merely examples, however; exploration and creative develop-
ment is the order of the day.
Presenting ACT content outside of the academic curriculum (see 
Project 2) has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, 
greater recruitment barriers may arise outside of the university curricu-
lum, as students may have to miss other classes or change work schedules 
to participate. On the other hand, when ACT is outside of the curricu-
lum, students volunteer on their own accord. This type of recruitment 
may select more for students already in some form of distress relative to 
students who are taking a class, which may allow more targeted pro-
grams. Conversely, presenting mindfulness and acceptance concepts as 
part of an existing class (see Projects 1, 3, and 4) offers the possibility of 
reaching students who would not seek help on their own accord, such as 
those described in the two opening vignettes to this chapter.
The issues of dosage (how long an ACT intervention is needed) and 
duration of effects (whether the ACT intervention will continue to have 
an effect in the long run) need to be investigated. For example, some 
participant feedback suggested that motivation to use the training skills 
may lessen over time (see Project 2). Therefore, additional forms of 
engagement to bolster these ACT classroom interventions could be 
added in the future. Recommendations include sending e-­mail reminders 
to practice the training skills, setting up an online forum where partici-
pants discuss their experiences and pose questions, and developing 
highly engaging, multi-­media, interactive web-­based ACT programs (see 
Levin, Pistorello, Seeley, & Hayes, under review, for an example of an 
online ACT program designed specifically for college students).
We do know that among college students with some level of distress, 
ACT in a classroom/training setting does reduce psychological distress 
(see Project 2), but we do not yet know if students who are not currently 
distressed will be less likely to develop mental health problems later in 
life if exposed to ACT concepts early in their college career. Project 1 
above will likely help elucidate this question, as freshman students, 75% 
of whom are not currently diagnosable with a mental health disorder, will 
be followed up to three years through structured interviews. Whether 
the data are negative or positive, it is clear that a good deal of additional 
development needs to occur.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Classroom Settings

Curriculum infusion (CI) has been utilized by many colleges and 
universities in substance abuse prevention efforts (e.g., Lederman, 
Stewart, & Russ, 2007). CI usually involves the recruitment of professors 
to incorporate information about alcohol and/or other drugs into the 
subject matter of their courses. Two of the projects described above 
(Projects 3 and 4) utilized a similar strategy, where they imparted skills 
in mindfulness and acceptance, delivered experientially, to decrease 
stigma/prejudice. These two projects showed that ACT content infused 
into psychology classes is not only acceptable (see Project 4) but also 
effective in increasing positive behavioral intentions towards members of 
different racial/ethnic origins (see Project 3). Colleges are increasingly 
more diverse both in terms of race/ethnicity and mental health disabili-
ties; yet, contact with different groups alone may not be enough to 
change behavior (see Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002). Infusion of 
mindfulness, acceptance, and values may provide an effective way over 
time for higher education settings to change cultural norms.
All four projects described above relied on mental health providers 
highly trained in ACT, but mindfulness is becoming widely applicable 
across campuses (see chapters 1, 10, and 12 also). Therefore, individuals 
who are not mental health providers may become involved in the deliv-
ery or infusion of mindfulness and acceptance content into classroom 
settings. As this occurs, it will become important to learn how to deliver 
these interventions with fidelity across varying levels of expertise. 
Overall, although it is still early and much needs to be learned, there are 
clear indications that mindfulness- and acceptance-­based approaches 
can make a positive difference in classroom settings.

olanda, the dean of students at a large public university, sits 
across the table from Ryan, a student withdrawing from the 
institution. As she probes into the reasons behind his desire to 
leave, it becomes evident that although he states the lack of financial 
resources as the impetus for his departure, he is actually detached from 
any meaningful community, without a sense of purpose for his educa-
tion, and genuinely bored with his classes. He claims that he is simply 
“going through the motions” of attending college and that he would 
prefer not to “waste his parents’ money” by continuing in an endeavor 
that he views as pointless. Regardless of the options that Yolanda pres-
ents, Ryan is unable to consider a divergent perspective. This type of 
scenario is common across student affairs departments, yet traditional 
approaches to student disengagement have been unable to significantly 
impact student departure rates.
Introduction
Today’s student services are situated within a context of rapid and pro-
found change, including increasing globalization, significant growth in 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
252
diversity and multiculturalism, low graduation rates, high levels of student 
disengagement, and ever-­evolving technology. Student affairs practitio-
ners are left with a choice: Do we keep doing what we’ve always done, 
attempting to avoid the challenges and inconveniences presented by 
change, or do we embrace these changes and explore the ways in which 
they offer the greatest opportunities for our institutions and students? 
Our response to this question will determine whether we are relegated to 
the sidelines of higher education, or become critical partners in the 
mission of promoting relevant learning and preparing our students for 
service to society.
Furthermore, the impact of our effectiveness will be influenced by 
the quality of our response. If we commit to embracing change, yet con-
tinue to view and present information as fixed, implying that it is true 
regardless of new or changing contexts, we will find ourselves engaged in 
frenzied attempts to respond to each wave of change. Likewise, our stu-
dents may retain several versions of context-­specific information, but this 
information is likely to become irrelevant within a context of continuous 
change. However, if we incorporate flexible ways of embracing change 
that emerge from attitudes and orientations of openness, not only will 
our experience as educators be more coherent, but our students may also 
develop more complex and fluid frameworks for understanding, making 
their learning more relevant. If Ryan had taken a more flexible approach 
to addressing his discontentment with the college environment, perhaps 
his experience would have been more satisfying and meaningful.
A growing number of educators and business leaders recognize that 
education within, and preparation for, a context of change requires a 
dynamic learning environment, wherein students are actively engaged in 
the learning process and actively involved with others (Association of 
American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U, 2002; Chickering & 
Reisser, 1993; Komives & Wagner, 2009). They emphasize the need for 
learning environments to incorporate characteristics such as openness, 
creativity, flexibility, and inquiry (AAC&U, 2007; Duderstadt, 2000; 
Tagg, 2004). Within such environments, learning transcends mere 
knowledge acquisition, and students have the opportunity to develop 
increasingly complex frameworks for understanding—­and are thus better 
prepared to navigate unforeseen change. However, despite this wide-
spread recognition, many institutions of higher education do not reflect 

================================================================================
Mindfulness in Student Affairs Practice
253
these characteristics, a discrepancy that suggests the significant chal-
lenge of creating dynamic learning environments.
Psychologist and educator Ellen Langer is among those who high-
light these shortcomings of formal education. In response, she advocates 
for an educational approach in which students “remain open to ways in 
which information may differ in various situations” (1997, p. 87). This 
approach, labeled mindful learning, is based upon the psychosocial 
concept of mindfulness and has implications for staff and students. The 
remainder of this chapter will describe the differences between mindless-
ness and mindfulness, will explore the possible implications of a mindful 
orientation for both student affairs administrators and student life pro-
gramming, and will address several inherent areas of resistance within 
higher education structures to a mindful orientation.
Langer’s Mindfulness
Mindfulness in this context has been defined as “the process of drawing 
novel distinctions” (Langer & Moldoveanu, 2000b, p. 220). It is charac-
terized by openness to new information, the continuous creation of new 
categories, and an increased awareness of multiple perspectives (Langer, 
1989, 1997). In contrast, mindlessness is characterized by automatic 
behavior that prevents attention to new signals, by entrapment in previ-
ously established categories, and by actions that are based upon a single 
perspective (Langer, 1997).
Mindlessness
Langer’s definition of mindlessness pertains to a few areas.
AUTOMATIC PILOT
Most of us can, in retrospect, identify times that we have functioned 
on automatic pilot. We may have arrived at work one day and wondered 
how we got there, unable to remember any of the details of that day’s 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
254
commute. Or, on a Saturday when preoccupied with a lengthy to-­do list, 
we may have intended to go to the store and instead found ourselves 
accidentally en route to work. These experiences demonstrate a ten-
dency to rely on previously created categories without engaging active 
thought—­a phenomenon described by Langer as mindlessness. The 
experience of being on automatic pilot is often related to repetition, 
which can lead to a tendency to rely on previous ways of learning, under-
standing, and acting (Langer, 2000). Mindlessness becomes problematic 
when these thoughtless ways of thinking become so ingrained that the 
ability to change or vary them in light of new information is lost (Langer 
& Moldoveanu, 2000a).
CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE
In addition to resulting from repetition, mindlessness can emerge in 
response to a single exposure to information. Such a situation can breed 
mindlessness if the information is presented as absolute and is received 
without consideration of alternate ways of understanding the informa-
tion (Langer, 2000). This is also described as a premature cognitive com-
mitment, wherein one forms a mindset upon an initial encounter with a 
person or idea, then clings to that initial mindset during similar encoun-
ters and fails to explore other understandings or applications of the infor-
mation (Chanowitz & Langer, 1981; Langer, 1989). Thus, mindlessness is 
associated with a lack of sensitivity to context, as information is viewed 
as fixed regardless of changes in circumstance or environment. 
Mindlessness therefore tends to freeze meaning and, as a result, limits 
one to a single perspective on information, ideas, and even people 
(Langer, 1989).
Mindfulness
In contrast, “mindfulness is a flexible state of mind in which we are 
actively engaged in the present, noticing new things and sensitive to 
context” (Langer, 2000, p. 220). The key characteristics of mindfulness 
include a continual creation of new categories, openness to new informa-
tion, and awareness of multiple perspectives.

================================================================================
Mindfulness in Student Affairs Practice
255
CREATING NEW CATEGORIES
Continually creating new categories keeps one attuned to the present 
context instead of being trapped in previously created categories and 
thus oblivious to new distinctions (Langer, 2000; Tanious, 2012). 
Reliance on previous categories can promote a tendency to interpret 
events through an existing lens, therefore limiting the extent of one’s 
engagement with, or efforts to accurately understand, new information. 
In contrast, the continuous creation of categories can expand one’s mind 
and scope of understanding, thus helping individuals to engage in 
ongoing discovery and preparing them for functioning within contexts of 
rapid change. The difference between being trapped in categories and 
constantly creating new categories can be observed in a myriad of student 
experiences. For example, two students with similar previous high school 
math experiences may respond differently to having to take a college 
math course. One student may immediately express fear or anxiety about 
the course, while the other welcomes it. Mindfulness theory might 
suggest that one plausible explanation of the students’ reactions is related 
to the extent to which they categorize information. It is possible that the 
first student holds a rigid view of “math” that was created by a previous 
negative experience, while the second student is open to the creation of 
new and evolving “math categories.” The second student is therefore able 
to view this particular math course through a new lens and thus perceive 
it as a novel area for discovery and learning, rather than a guaranteed 
repeated bad experience.
OPENNESS TO NEW INFORMATION
Openness to new information refers to an active awareness of 
changed signals, resulting in an “increasingly differentiated information 
base” (Langer, 1989, p. 67). In addition to an awareness of changing 
information, openness refers to receptivity to new ways of thinking. 
Thus, openness has intrapersonal implications, as it is related to recog-
nizing the limitations of one’s existing way of knowing and the need for 
more complex ways of knowing (Wawrzynski & Pizzolato, 2006). In 
addition, it has interpersonal implications as the realization of one’s own 
limitations can lead to an increased appreciation and valuing of the per-
spectives of others.

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
256
MULTIPLICITY OF PERSPECTIVES
The final characteristic of mindfulness, an awareness of multiple 
perspectives, directly opposes a single-­minded perspective or label. As 
indicated above, this awareness may refer to internal consideration of 
various perspectives on information or ideas, or to openness to the points 
of view of others. Whereas mindlessness invites opportunities for misun-
derstanding or devaluing other people and perspectives (Galinsky & 
Moskowitz, 2000; Gehlbach, 2004), mindfulness encourages openness to 
and appreciation of other individuals and various points of view. This 
characteristic of mindfulness also incorporates an understanding that all 
ideas, people, and objects can be many things, depending on one’s per-
spective or vantage point (Langer, 1989).
These key characteristics each have their own merit, but they also 
interact with and reinforce one another. For example, openness refers to 
a state of mind that is not only open to new information, but also open 
to different points of view (Langer, 1989). Openness is thus directly 
linked to an awareness of different points of view or multiple perspec-
tives. The reciprocal is also true, given that “by viewing the same infor-
mation through several perspectives, we actually become more open to 
that information” (Langer, 1997, p. 133). In combination, these three 
characteristics represent the broad concept of mindfulness, a flexible 
state of mind that tolerates and even welcomes uncertainty. This descrip-
tion highlights one of the concepts associated with mindfulness: curios-
ity (Langer, 2000).
Divergent Perspectives on Mindfulness
The multifaceted concept of mindfulness has been defined and 
explored through divergent perspectives across the ages. Embedded in a 
Western approach to scientific discovery, Langer’s approach to mindful-
ness emerged from a study of the effect of mindless behavior. Whereas 
approaches such as Mindfulness-­Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-­
Zinn, 1984) have roots in ancient religious traditions such as Buddhism 
and Christian mysticism, these ancient approaches may place a high 
moral value on mindfulness as a means to right action and compassion. 
Additionally, some of these methods are designed to quiet one’s thought 
processes. Conversely, Langer’s approach encourages intentional thought 

================================================================================
Mindfulness in Student Affairs Practice
257
through an emphasis on the creation of new categories and disrupting 
one’s automatic thought processes (Langer, 1997, 2000). Both traditions, 
however, underscore the reduction in existing mental categories that 
leaves an individual reliant on stereotypes and trapped in binary concep-
tualizations (Langer, 1989; Langer, Bashner, & Chanowitz, 1985). 
Langer’s conceptualization of mindfulness has been utilized throughout 
colleges and universities and was chosen as the focus of this chapter 
because of its clear conceptual alignment with curiosity and engagement 
in learning, two deeply held values of the higher education academy.
Mindfulness and Curiosity
Curiosity has been defined as:
The recognition, pursuit, and intense desire to explore novel, 
challenging, and uncertain events. When curious, we are fully 
aware and receptive to whatever exists and might happen in the 
present moment. Curiosity motivates people to act and think in 
new ways and investigate, be immersed, and learn about what-
ever is the immediate interesting target of their attention. 
(Kashdan & Silva, 2009, p. 368)
This description of curiosity captures many of the characteristics of 
mindfulness. Both promote a posture toward knowing that incorporates 
openness, a present awareness, and an ongoing pursuit of learning. As 
student affairs professionals, taking such a posture can help to ensure 
that the work we do is relevant within a context of change. Promoting 
such an orientation also has significant implication for students. 
Noticing and exploring novelty can increase interest, involvement, 
engagement, and motivation to learn (Kashdan & Silva, 2009; Langer, 
1997). Thus, characteristics of openness to uncertainty and an interest 
in novelty, whether incorporated into the presentation of information or 
in the mind of the student, can enhance learning (Langer, 1997). 
Studies have found mindful learning to be associated with flexibility, 
creativity, enjoyment, and performance (Langer, 1997). Mindfulness, 
therefore, has implications for both the immediate learning experience 
as well as for future applications of learned material or applications in 
different contexts. In the midst of rapidly changing contexts, mindful 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
258
learning can help prepare students for “the as-­yet-­to-­be-­known future” 
(Langer, 1997, p. 81).
Mindfulness and Engaged Learning
Engaged learning is considered to be one of the key factors for 
student learning and success (Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, & Whitt, 2005; 
Newman, 1992), in part because of its association with a host of educa-
tional outcomes including student learning (Astin, 1993; Kuh et al., 
2005), achievement (Greenway, 2005), and persistence (Milem & Berger, 
1997). However, despite extensive research, disengagement is rampant in 
educational settings, where many students are not inclined toward active 
thinking. This problem was demonstrated in a recent survey of public 
university students, in which 15% of second-­year students reported being 
so disengaged that they slept frequently during class (Hurtado, 2007). 
These findings suggest that active engagement or thinking cannot be 
assumed in educational settings (Bargh, 1997).
Schreiner and Louis (2006) define engaged learning as “a positive 
energy invested in one’s own learning, evidenced by meaningful process-
ing, attention to what is happening in the learning moment, and active 
participation in learning activities” (p. 6). This multidimensional con-
ceptualization of engagement in learning theoretically aligns with the 
construct of mindfulness, particularly due to the emphases on meaning-
ful processing and a focus on the present moment. Likewise, the rampant 
disengagement among students parallels mindlessness. The interactions 
between the concepts of engagement, curiosity, and mindfulness suggest 
that the promotion of mindfulness is critical for promoting effective 
learning contexts. The following section provides useful examples of 
institutional approaches to mindfulness education.
Use of Mindfulness in Student 
Life Programming
Promotion of mindfulness through student life programming requires 
both the development of a professional staff that regularly practices

mindfulness and the provision of informative programs for students. 
Without the practical experience of living a nonjudgmental and aware 
life, we would have a difficult time imparting the benefits and challenges 
of mindfulness to students. Additionally, student services professionals 
must develop creative, novel ways to introduce the central tenets of 
mindfulness to student leaders, resident assistants, first-­year students, 
peer leaders, athletes, and other students who are involved in student life 
programming.
Staff Development Initiatives
As student affairs professionals experience growing demands on our 
time and energy, staff development initiatives focused on introducing 
mindful practices are critical to maintaining a vibrant team of profes-
sionals. These efforts should focus on diminishing the negative effects of 
mindless behaviors resulting from a life lived on autopilot and encourag-
ing the creation of new categories necessary to establish a fresh perspec-
tive on programs and individuals. The following programs exemplify 
ways to introduce these concepts to student development professionals.
In an effort to highlight the value of slowing the pace of life to expe-
rience the rewards of a more mindful life, Baylor University’s Student 
Life Division executed a silent retreat. Participants were given periodic 
instructions that reflected the work of Brennan Manning, a Franciscan 
priest and author (2009), and asked to remain in silence throughout the 
morning. Silence was experienced in 10-­minute intervals, with brief 
reflective thoughts spoken throughout a two-­hour program. The experi-
ence of quieting the mind to allow for the creation of new mental catego-
ries was disconcerting for some and liberating for others.
Professional conferences provide another avenue for the introduc-
tion of mindful practice into student affairs work. During the 2010 
National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) 
conference, a presentation introduced mindfulness as an important 
element of developing curiosity in our students (Hulme, Shushok, & 
Klinger, 2010). The presentation covered such topics as the value of 
uncertainty, perspective-­taking, and the deconstruction of mental cate-
gories and heightened attendees’ perceived need to live a more mindful

life. A practical exercise to illustrate mindlessness was enacted. Attendees 
were asked to retrace their path from the door to the building where they 
entered to their seat in the meeting room. Additionally, they were 
instructed to make a list of everything they missed as they walked 
through the building. Upon returning, a master list was created of items 
overlooked as the participants initially entered the room on autopilot. A 
lively discussion followed that revealed the amount of time each person 
spends in a state of mindlessness. Professional development activities 
such as these require a minimal investment of time and resources but 
help in the process of developing mindful awareness in student life 
administrators.
Additionally, programs that foster mindful practice in the Langer 
tradition challenge student development administrators to explore the 
multiplicity of perspectives. For example, the chief student affairs and 
academic affairs officers at George Fox University (GFU) spent 24 hours 
experiencing the life of a student. As a result of living in the residence 
halls and attending classes, the administrators viewed the university 
through new mental categories. Simple autopilot tasks like finding a 
parking space on campus became mindful activities that raised a new 
level of awareness of the GFU college experience. 
Another similar program found on various campuses that allows the 
student body president and vice president for student services to shadow 
each other for a day encourages mindful exploration of divergent 
perspectives.
Student Programming Initiatives
Student affairs staff development programs create the foundation for 
the promulgation of mindfulness education across the entire co-curricu-
lar college experience; however, as illustrated in this book, programs 
directed at encouraging the development of mindfulness among college 
students primarily originate from counseling centers.
As described below, Virginia Tech and Azusa Pacific University 
(APU) serve as examples of universities attempting to encourage mindful 
behavior throughout their student affairs programs and services.

================================================================================

VIRGINIA TECH’S CURIOSITY ASPIRATION
Virginia Tech encourages mindful practice through a focus on devel-
oping curiosity. One of the Division of Student Life’s five aspirations for 
student learning states: “Virginia Tech students will be inspired to lead 
lives of curiosity, embracing a lifelong commitment to intellectual devel-
opment” (www.dsa.vt.edu/aspirations/curiosity.php). An initial staff 
retreat introduced the student affairs division to the concept of curiosity 
and mindfulness. As a result of this event, a cross-­divisional team was 
formed to create meaningful curiosity-­oriented programs. Additionally, 
in consultation with Todd Kashdan, author of Curious?: Discover the 
Missing Ingredient to a Fulfilling Life (2009), residence hall curriculum is 
being developed to encourage students to embrace uncertainty and 
divergent perspectives.
AZUSA PACIFIC UNIVERSITY’S STUDENT 
LEADERSHIP PROGRAM
The development of effective leaders is often stated within the 
mission of colleges and universities as well as appearing as a specific 
outcome related to student development and the out-­of-­class curriculum. 
APU’s leadership development efforts combine a curricular and co-­
curricular approach through a leadership minor. In 2010, one of the five 
courses in the minor was chosen to integrate a four-­week mindfulness 
curriculum and to measure its effectiveness in improving a student’s level 
of mindful awareness and quality of socially responsible leadership. Below 
is a summary of the topic for each session.
Session 1: The Power of the Mind in Leadership. “The Power of the 
Mind in Leadership” served as the focus for the introductory session. 
The purpose of the first session was to demonstrate the relationship of 
one’s thoughts to his or her ultimate effectiveness as a leader. The impor-
tance of a mindful perspective was introduced and examined in light of 
its practical application to each student’s own life. Four aspects of 
Langer’s mindlessness construct—­including automatic behavior, cate-
gory traps, acting from a single perspective, and contextual influences—­
were investigated through applied activities (1997).

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
262
One specific exercise used during the first session to bring attention 
to mindlessness was the APU picture hunt. Students were requested via 
e-­mail before class to take pictures of objects on campus that they walk 
by every day and don’t notice. They e-­mailed five of their best pictures to 
the professor, and a slide show illustrating articles that were missed on 
campus was created for class. This particular exercise created significant 
discussion and was mentioned on end-­of-­semester evaluations as a note-
worthy learning experience.
Another exercise was created to introduce mindfulness through 
embracing novelty. Each student was asked to perform two novel activi-
ties throughout the week and write a reflection paper on each. The array 
of novel activities performed provided great fodder for engaging and 
instructive conversations in class. One student who decided to wear his 
tuxedo to his classes remarked on the power of context and how this 
simple activity had created a newfound awareness of difference. (Power 
Point slides for Session One are available as Appendix 12A at www 
.newharbinger.com/22225.)
Session 2: The Leader’s Strengths and the Impact of Context. “The 
Leader’s Strengths and the Impact of Context” introduced students to 
the influence of individual personality traits on their attention to infor-
mation in a particular context. Through the use of the Clifton 
StrengthsFinder (Gallup, 1999) students were introduced to the effect 
their strengths have on communication preferences, ability to deal with 
change, approach to time and structure, conflict management style, and 
study habits. Through interactive exercises utilizing their strengths, stu-
dents began to understand that their personality characteristics actually 
create blindness to certain aspects of their environment and promote 
mindless evaluation of people, places, and activities.
Additionally, mindfulness based on Langer’s conceptualization is 
sensitive to the impact of content on our systems of evaluation. To intro-
duce the topic of context, students were asked to sit on the floor for the 
last fifteen minutes of class if they were physically able to accomplish 
this. A lively discussion occurred about the change in the dynamic of the 
class that resulted from sitting on the floor. Students who had not previ-
ously been vocally engaged in the class began to speak. The conversation 
was more animated and relaxed. This visible change in the class made 
students more aware of their surroundings and class dynamics.

================================================================================

The execution of this class raised issues related to the relationship of 
mindfulness to self-­awareness and identity formation. Approximately 
15% of the class appeared disengaged during the class discussions on 
individual strengths and subsequent exercises. Whether they were 
uncomfortable with the personal nature of the class or developmentally 
they were experiencing Marcia’s (1993) moratorium or foreclosure stage 
of identity development, it is hard to ascertain from the visual evidence.
Session 3: The Social Mind of the Leader. The topic of perspective-­
taking was addressed in the third session, titled “The Social Mind of the 
Leader” (see Appendix 12B for associated Power Point slides). The objec-
tive for this session was to introduce students to Langer’s emphasis on 
the mindful awareness of multiple perspectives. Perspective-­taking was 
demonstrated through an exercise based on understanding life through 
another person’s strengths. Utilizing the knowledge of the Clifton 
StrengthsFinder gained during the preceding class session, students were 
given randomly chosen strengths and asked to react to various scenarios 
as a person with those strengths might react. An example of a scenario 
would be:
You have been assigned a group project to create a leadership class 
for a local junior high school. Frank, a member of the group, is 
extremely competitive and drives the group to excellence in hopes of 
being the best group project in class. How do you respond to Frank?
This was an extremely difficult task for some, as they were constantly 
reverting back to their own perspectives on Frank as opposed to the 
perspective of someone with their assigned strengths. The class discus-
sion focused on the effect our strengths have on our tendency to see life 
through our own perspectives as opposed to a more mindful approach 
that encourages the seeking out of other viewpoints. An extensive list of 
barriers to considering other perspectives was also generated through 
class discussion, and an exercise based on active listening was assigned to 
further the students’ development of a mindful awareness of divergent 
perceptions.
After completion of the third session, it was clear that although all 
students appeared to be readily engaged in the activity, their ability to 
hold opposing perspectives was idiosyncratic to the individual. Hobson 
(2002) posits that perspective-­taking is an innate social and biological 

================================================================================

264
process that is sensitive to a gradual process of development over time. It 
was evident that the level of mindful awareness based on the ability to 
see life from varying perspectives is significantly influenced by one’s 
developmental stage. A wide body of research on mindfulness-­based 
interventions also shows that most of these processes can be learned and 
that such learning is crucial in effecting values-­based changes in one’s 
life (see Levin, Hildebrandt, Lillis, & Hayes, 2012, for a meta-­analysis).
Session 4: Building a Hopeful Mind. The final session of the four-­week 
intervention included the juxtaposition of living in a state of present 
awareness and developing a hopeful future, complete with goals and stra-
tegic pathways. The session, “Building a Hopeful Mind,” introduced stu-
dents to a process titled “strategic futuring,” which allows for a careful 
consideration of present strengths and values as one sets future aims. 
Students were led through an exercise to quiet their mind and to allow 
their imagination to form pictures of their future. Additionally, students 
were asked to reflect on the past three weeks and write a two-­page reflec-
tion paper on the impact of mindfulness on their daily activities. One 
student wrote: “I had no idea all that I was missing each day.”
Upon further review of the last session, the impact of the overall 
intervention may have been strengthened if the last session had focused 
exclusively on present awareness and the creation of new categories. The 
complexity of balancing future and present awareness may have dimin-
ished the overall understanding of developing a mindful practice and 
perspective. It is possible that this might be an advanced skill that can 
best be presented after students have already developed solid mindful-
ness skills.
The following section will provide significant empirical support for 
the need for an increase in mindfulness education embedded in the cur-
riculum, followed by a summary of findings from this Leadership Training 
program.
Empirical Considerations
Langer and colleagues conducted numerous short-­term empirical 
research studies related to mindfulness and learning. These studies 
revealed prevalent learning myths that diminish creativity and curiosity 

================================================================================
Mindfulness in Student Affairs Practice
265
and limit true learning, enjoyment in the learning process, and realiza-
tion of learning potential (Langer, 1997). These myths are associated 
with mindlessness, whereas mindfulness, or the continual process of 
noticing new things or making novel distinctions, is associated with 
increased levels of involvement (Langer, 1997).
The internal or external presence of the mindful characteristics of 
an interest in novelty and openness to uncertainty can enhance involve-
ment in learning (Langer, 1997). Internally, an individual can benefit 
from embracing these characteristics and utilizing them as a lens for 
understanding new experiences and information. Alternatively, these 
characteristics can be encouraged from an external perspective, such as 
when they are incorporated into the presentation of information. Studies 
have demonstrated associations between mindful learning and creativity 
(Langer, 1997; Langer & Piper, 1987), increased levels of enjoyment in 
learning (Langer, 1997), enhanced academic performance (Lieberman 
& Langer, 1995), improved memory (Bodner & Langer, 1995; Langer, 
1997), and flexible application of information (Langer, 1997; Langer, 
Hatem, Joss, & Howell, 1989). Therefore, mindfulness has implications 
for the immediate learning environment, as well as for applications of 
learned material in future or different contexts.
Findings from our own project on Student Leadership training at 
APU showed some promising but not definitive results. This study used a 
quasi-­experimental, pretest-­posttest, non-­randomized control group 
design. The participants were 45 undergraduate students who were 
enrolled in either mindfulness-­based student leadership courses (treat-
ment group) or traditional leadership courses (control group; Komives, 
Lucas, & McMahon, 2007). Ultimately, pretests and posttests of the four-­
week intervention revealed that the control group’s mean mindfulness 
scores decreased slightly during four weeks of a traditional leadership 
course, supporting the notion that educational environments may inad-
vertently promote mindlessness, left to their own devices. Over the same 
time period, the treatment group’s mindfulness scores increased slightly, 
suggesting the possibility that the intervention may have helped protect 
students against the tendency toward mindlessness. However, although 
these changes in mindfulness scores moved in the predicted direction, the 
differences were not statistically significant. Thus, the findings indicate 
that it may be possible to impact students’ mindfulness levels, but they also 
indicate the necessity to increase the strength and duration of such 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
266
interventions. Although this study had limited quantifiable results, class 
evaluations indicate a high level of satisfaction with the curriculum. 
However, upon reflection after completion of the intervention, the con-
nection between leadership effectiveness and mindfulness may not have 
been compelling enough to create what Ritchhart and Perkins (2000) 
term as a mindful disposition. Traditional-­aged college students might not 
possess the breadth of experience necessary to understand the relationship 
of mindful constructs and their personal approach to leading others; 
therefore, the intervention did not appear to create a strong inclination or 
desire for developing a mindful practice. Future studies, perhaps using a 
variety of methodologies, may be useful in understanding these obstacles.
Although there are numerous examples of efforts student affairs 
practitioners are making to promote mindfulness, creating an environ-
ment within a college or university that promotes mindful practice is 
challenging and often is not subjected to controlled program evaluation 
efforts. The final section will offer suggestions on how to develop a sus-
tained program resulting in a deep and lasting impact.
Final Words
Programs encouraging the pursuit of mindful practice within higher edu-
cation are frequently developed on the margins of an institution. 
However, to deeply impact the lives of college students, those programs 
must be intertwined through a variety of curricular and co-­curricular 
offerings. The following section will offer three pieces of advice to student 
affairs practitioners striving to create a culture of mindfulness within 
their institutions.
Create a Compelling Case for Mindfulness
Despite being practiced for centuries in religious orders, mindfulness 
is a relatively new concept to higher education professionals. The term is 
laden with misconceptions and preconceived erroneous notions regard-
ing the purpose of mindful practice. Therefore, a compelling case for why 
an individual or institution would endeavor to learn and practice mind-
fulness needs to be established.

================================================================================
Mindfulness in Student Affairs Practice
267
The impact of a college student mindfulness intervention may be 
improved if three components of a mindful disposition are present: sen-
sitivity, inclination, and ability (Ritchhart & Perkins, 2000; Tanious, 
2012). Most college students will not have a natural sensitivity or inclina-
tion to the notion of drawing novel distinctions or examining the impact 
of preexisting mental categories. It appears that they are, however, drawn 
to information that promotes academic success, social integration, and 
life satisfaction. Successful promotion of mindfulness programming 
should establish a clear link to the outcomes that garner a student’s 
attention. The possibility that most of a college student’s life is spent in a 
mindless state, using Langer’s definition, makes it difficult to arrest her 
natural disposition toward unreflective behavior; therefore, careful atten-
tion must be paid to establishing the connection to outcomes reflecting 
students’ interests.
Student affairs professionals may be more inclined to understand the 
need for developing a greater level of mindfulness in their lives; however, 
our hectic schedules often inhibit our actual attention to novelty, per-
spective, and context. Harvard business school professor and change 
theorist John Kotter discusses the need to create a sense of urgency 
before change may occur (Kotter, 2008). Perhaps presenting the negative 
effect that mindlessness has on job performance, curiosity, and relation-
ship satisfaction would produce the sense of urgency and requisite moti-
vation to begin a mindful practice. Both students and professional staff 
must be provided with a compelling reason to change current habits to 
become more mindful in their daily lives.
Establish Ties to Behaviors that Are 
Valued in the Higher Education Domain
The term mindfulness is often associated with images of Buddhist 
monks and New Age bookstores. Because skepticism is a long-­standing 
higher education value, proponents of embedding mindful practice in 
the co-­curricular and curricular aspects of higher education may want to 
consider aligning the term with valued constructs such as curiosity and 
engagement. For some administrative leaders and faculty, developing 
mindfulness may seem like an inappropriate learning objective because 
of the personal nature of the practice. However, engagement in the 

================================================================================
Mindfulness & Acceptance for Counseling College Students
268
educational process has gained significant attention over the last ten 
years. The relationship of mindfulness to engagement and curiosity dem-
onstrated earlier in this chapter should be exploited to lessen the impact 
of preconceived notions and heighten the understanding of the role 
mindfulness plays in the learning process.
Create Division-­Wide, Cross-­Functional 
Ownership of Mindfulness Initiatives
If students such as Ryan, mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, 
are going to be impacted by mindfulness practice, the exposure to mind-
fulness constructs must not be relegated to one office or person. Ryan 
must learn about the value of making novel distinctions and searching 
for divergent perspectives in the residence halls as well as in the class-
room. Creating alliances with individuals from a diversity of functions 
interested in the outcomes associated with mindful behaviors has a mul-
tiplying effect across a student services division and institution. Although 
those alliances may be small in number and difficult to find in the begin-
ning, ultimately they have the power to transform Ryan’s experience 
from disengagement to engagement.
In conclusion, Langer’s work on mindfulness provides student ser-
vices professionals and students a way to positively address the fast-­paced 
environment that surrounds them. Through drawing novel distinctions, 
valuing divergent perspectives, and becoming receptive to new informa-
tion, professionals can transform the student experience from one of 
mindless disengagement to curiosity-­driven engagement.
